<a name="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
This is the first of three lectures on inheritance. This lecture discusses the
general principles involved in defining classes in an inheritance hierarchy and
using the hierarchy to find attributes of objects. It focuses on the rules
needed to understand single inheritance, showing an example using counters. The
second lecture discusses multiple inheritance and generalizes these rules; it
actually includes code that illustrates how classes reference each other and
how attributes are found by Python in complicated inheritance hierarchies. The
third lecture discusses various concrete uses of inheritance and how we can use
inheritance to simplify real programming.

Just an inheritance (of money) makes the life of descendants easier,
inheritance (of attributes) makes derived classes easier to write.
</pre>

<a name="class"><h1>Class Inheritance in Python</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
At present we know about defining classes and constructing objects that are
instances of classes. We have explored various relationships between an object
and the class from which it was constructed (including adding attributes to
objects after they are constructed and adding attributes to classes after they
are defined).

We have studed the Fundamental Equation of Object-Oriented Programming (FEOOP)
to determine how Python locates attributes for objects, mostly meaning how
methods are called on objects: by first trying to locate the attribute in the
object itself, and if that fails, locating the attribute in the class from
which the object was constructed. Objects mostly store their own state
attributes (data), while the classes they are constructed from mostly store
their behavior attributes (methods). So objects keep their own state but share
the methods that operate on them; sometimes, though, objects can store special
methods that apply only to them and class object store state that is shared by
objects as well.

To get to full object-oriented programming, we must also learn how to define
derived classes from base classes (aka create subclasses from superclasses)
and learn how objects constructed from these derived/sub classes behave in
regards to inherited state and behavior: specifically, we will learn that all
classes are defined in an inheritance hierarchy and learn how attibutes of
instance objects can found by searching the objects themselves first, and if
needed search the inheritance hierarchy.

Fundamentally, what inheritance is about is writing small derived classes that
reuse attributes from base classes in a natural way. The attribute location
process is captured by augmenting the meaning of The Fundamental Equation of
Object-Oriented Programming for class inheritance hierarchies (below we discuss
a simple extension for single-inheritance, which is the most common kind of
inheritance; in the next lecture we discuss the more complicated but complete
extension for multiple inheritance).

We can define a trivial class with no state/behavior (not even an __init__
method) in Python by just writing

  class C:
      pass

Note the lack of parentheses after the class name C (just a colon). This means
that the class C is implicitly a class derived from the "object" class (yes,
there is a class named "object" in Python: try x = object() and print(x)); the
object class acts as the root of Python's inheritance hierarchy. The object
class itself is defined in the builtins module and serves as the base class by
default of any classes defined with no explicit base class.

In fact, this class defines very many methods (e.g.,  __repr__, __setattr__,
etc.). We can call the repr function (which calls the __repr__ method) on
objects constructed from classes that don't define __repr___ and Python will
still find a __repr__ method too call. Because, if we do not define such
methods in our classes, they are inherited; when we do define a method like
__repr__ in a derived class, it overrides (see this term defined and explained
below) the __repr__ method inherited from the "object" class.

If we want to specify one or more different base classes when definining a
class, we must put their names between the parentheses, separated by commas.

So, the meaning of class C: -with no parentheses- is the same as

  class C(object):
      pass

In both cases we illustrate the base/derived inheritance relationship with the
simple hierarchy: the derived class refers upward to its direct base class.

    object
       ^
       |
       C

There actually is a reference in the derived class C to the base class
"object" which we will use in the next lecture: the arrow's direction is
meaningful.

Note that many other classe that we know inherit only from the object class
(list, set, and dict), and we shall soon see that defaultdict inherits from
dict). Here is how we show the inheritance hierarchy of these classes.

                 object
              ^     ^     ^
             /      |      \
           list    set    dict
                           ^
                           |
                      defaultdict

If we use only single-inheritance the resulting inheritance hierarchy is an
N-ary tree with object at its root. Derived classes are children of their base
classes. Note that the derived classes can themselves be base classes of other
derived classes (e.g., dict). Eventually (tracing from any class towards the
root of the inheritance hierarchy) -following arrows from a derived class to
its base class- will lead upward in the inheritance tree until the root (the
object class) is reached. The situation gets a bit more complicated when
multiple-inheritance is allowed (more details in the next lecture).

So in this lecture we will being seeing class definitions like

  class Derived_Class(Base_Class):			# single-inheritance

and in the next lecture like

  class Derived_Class(Base_Class1, Base_Class2, ...):	# multiple-inheritance

Many languages support just single-inheritance (a derived class can have only
one direct base class: Java and Smalltalk are examples of such languages) but
Python (like C++) supports multiple inheritance: a derived class can have many
direct base classes. Once we understand the general principal of locating
attributes in a single-inheritance hierarchy, we can generalize the look up
rules for multiple-inheritance hierarchies (where our knowledge of
pre-order traversal, from the lectures on trees, will be important to our
understanding; forgot what that was? go back and read about it).

Finally, note an asymmetry: a derived class specifically states the name of
(and refers to) its base classes, but a base class says nothing about (and
doesn't refer to or know anything about) its derived classes. There is no way
for a base class to know what derived classes will inherit from it: so derived
classes can access attributes in their base classes, but base classes cannot
access attributes in their derived classes.

<a name="equation"><h1>The Fundamental Equation of Object-Oriented Programming
(generalizing for single-Inheritance)</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
At present we know that instance objects refer to the class objects they are 
constructed from, and we can use the type function on any instance to return a
reference to the class object that it was constructed from. When we look up an
attibute of an instance, Python first looks for the attribute in the namespace
of the instance object itself, but it if doesn't find the attribute there, it
looks for the attribute in the class the object was constructed from. We
captured this rule in the Fundamental Equation of Object-Oriented Programming
(shown again below) in its current form, but soon expanded for inheritance. So,
if m is a method, we have seen that

  o.m(...)  -> type(o).m(o,...) for method attributes
  o.a       -> type(o).a        for data attributes

When locating a method attribute for instance o, if it is not found in o itself
(it typically isn't) Python uses the attribute in the type(o) class: the class
o was constructed from, calling that method with o as the first argument (which
is why methods defined in classes all have the first parameter named self). By
this mechanism, an object doesn't need to store in its own namespace all the
methods that operate on it. The methods are mostly stored (and shared) in the
class object for the instance object, and located there as needed.

This mechanism works for non-method attributes too: if any data attribute is not
found in the instance object's namespace (although state is typically found
there), Python will try to locate it by using the namespace of the class the
instance object was constructed from. So, it is possible for objects to share
data in its class's namespaces, just as methods are shared.

A useful example of data sharing might occur in a Person class. Suppose that
we need to store how many fingers every person (object constructed from that
class) has. We could store this information by adding an attribute to every
person object (e.g., person1.fingers = 10). But the vast majority of people
have 10 fingers, so we could store Person.fingers = 10 (an attribute in the
Person class). Now if we don't store the fingers attribute in the person1
object, it will be found in the Person class object, with value 10. If person1
has fewer than 10 fingers, we can store person1.fingers = 9; now, for person1,
the fingers attribute will be found in the object itself, not in its class.
Using this approach, we can save space by storing the fingers attribute only
for people not having 10 fingers (likely to be a small percentage of all the
people objects).

We now generalize this look up mechanism for single-inheritance hierarchies:
Python first tries to find the attribute in the instance object; if Python
fails, it next tries to find the attribute in the class object from which the
instance was constructed; if Python fails, it tries to find the attribute in
the base class of the class from which the instance was constructed; ... If
Python does not find an attribute in a class, it next tries to find it in the
base class of that class, and continues until it reaches the object class: if
Python fails to find the attribute in the object class, it raises an
AttributeError exception.

Pictorally, where Python looks for an o.attribute

Examine the following two simple classes (which are in the counts.py module that
you can download with this lecture). We can examine and use the Counter class by
itself (it is a fully working class), but Counter also acts as the base class
of the derived Modular_Counter class. Together, most interesting issues
concerning inheritance are illustrated simply in these two classes, in which
Counter is the base class and Modular_Counter is the derived class.

class Counter:                      # implicitly use object as its base class
    hierarchy_depth = 1		    # object is depth 0, Counter is 1 beneath it
    counter_base = 0  		    # how many times Counter.__init__ called

    def __init__(self,init_value=0):
        assert init_value >= 0,\
            'Counter.__init__ init_value('+str(init_value)+') < 0'
        self._value = init_value
        Counter.counter_base += 1    

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self._value)
        
    def reset(self):
        self._value = 0
        
    def inc(self):

    def __init__(self,init_value,modulus):
        assert modulus >= 1,\
            'Modular_Counter.__init__ modulus('+str(init_value)+') < 1'
        assert 0 <= init_value < modulus,\
            'Modular_Counter.__init__ init_value('+str(init_value)+') not in [0,'+str(modulus)+')'
        Counter.__init__(self,init_value)
        self._modulus = modulus
        Modular_Counter.counter_derived += 1    
    
    def __str__(self):
        return Counter.__str__(self)+' mod '+str(self._modulus)
        
    # Note, calling self.value_of() and self.reset is equivalent to (and
    #   preferred to) calling Counter.value_of(self) and Counter.reset(self)
    # But it is critical that Counter.inc(self) is called that way, because
    #   calling self.inc() would be an infinitely recursive call to inc.
    def inc(self):
        if self.value_of() == self._modulus - 1:
            self.reset()
        else:
            Counter.inc(self)
        
    def modulus_of(self):
        return self._modulus

The main script at the bottom of the module creates Counter and Modular_Counter
objects and then allows the user to type in commands using the names c and
mc (including defining new/more names). You can put more code down there using
c and mc, or enter commands that are executed by calling the exec function.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import prompt

    c = Counter(0)
    mc = Modular_Counter(0,3)

    while True:
        try:
            exec(prompt.for_string('Command'))
        except Exception as report:
            import traceback
            traceback.print_exc()

----------

The Counter base class

First we will discuss the Counter class, and then discuss the Modular_Counter
class, which is derived from the base class Counter.

The Counter class defines two class state names (hierarchy_depth, which doesn't
change and counter_base which is incremented in __init__) and the class method
names __init__, __str__, reset, inc, and value_of.

(1) hierarchy_depth is an int representing the depth of the Counter class in
the N-ary inheritance tree: it is 1, because it is below the root of the tree,
the object class (which has depth 0).

(2) counter_base is an int that counts how many times __init__ in the Counter
class is called (it is called when we construct Counter objects, but also when
we construct Modular_Counter objects: which calls __init__ directly: it is
common for __init__ in the derived class to call __init__ in its base class
(base classes for multiple inheritance).

(3) __init__ initalizes each Counter object to have one piece of state: an int
that is always (so it must start) >= 0 representing the counter's value. It
verifies this property of init_value first, and then increments counter_base.

So, understand the following difference: the Counter class object stores the
attributes hierarchy_depth and counter_base attribute (as well as all the other
method attributes). Each object constructed from the Counter class stores its
own _value attribute (and shares the attributes in the Counter class using the
Fundamental Equation of Object-Oriented Programming).

(4) __str__ is a query that returns a string representing the Counter object's
_value attribute.

(5) reset is a command that resets the Counter object's _value attribute to 0

(6) inc is a command that increases the Counter object's _value attribute by 1

(7) value_of is a query that returns the _value attribute of the Counter object
The difference between (4) and (7) is that (4) returns a str while (7) returns
an int.

Using the code in main, we can construct and experiment with objects from the
Counter class: looking up state/calling methods on c (an object already
constructed in the code) or constructing more Counter objects and doing the
same on them. For example, try

c = Counter(0) 	    	    	 # OK

print(c.hiearchy_depth)		 # prints 1
print(c.counter_base)		 # prints 1 (because c = ...)

c.inc()				 # OK
c.inc()				 # OK
c.inc()				 # OK

print(c)			 # prints 3
print(c.value_of())		 # prints 3


----------

The Modular_Counter derived class

Now we will move on to discussing the Modular_Counter class. We will classify
every attribute usable in this class as

(a)a new attribute defined in the class (not an inherited attribute)
(b)an inherited attribute (not defined/overridden)
(c)an inherited attribute (re)defined in the class (overriding an inherited one)

These last two options rely on an understanding of what it means for a derived
class to override an inherited attribute. A derived class overrides an inherited
attribute if it defines an attribute (using the same name) as an attribute it
inherits: one defined in its base class, the base class of its base class, etc.
all the way back to the object class at the root of the inheritance hierarchy.

When we describe the Modular_Counter class below, we will discuss alld its
defined  attributes in these terms. Generally a modular counter is a special
kind of counter. In fact, derived classes are often specializations of base
classes: but for inheritance to be natural, all operations on the base class
must make sense on the derived class, although the derived class may change the
meaning of (override) the inherited attributes and define new attributes).

Modular counters can store values between 0 up to but not including the modulus
(so the biggest a value can get is modulus-1): think of a counter for strikes
in baseball as a modulus 3 counter. A batter goes from 0 strikes to 1 strikes
to 2 strikes to being out, with the next batter starting again back at 0
strikes.

The Modular_Counter class defines two class names storing state:
hierarchy_depth is (c), which doesn't change and counter_derived is (a) which is
incremented in __init__) and the class method names __init__ is (c), __str__ 
is (c), inc is (c), and modulus_of is (a). It also inherits and does not
override (all are b) the attributes counter_base, reset, and value_of.

(1) hierarchy_depth is an int representing the depth of the Modular_Counter
class in the N-ary inheritance tree: it is 2, because it is derived from the
Counter class, whose depth is 1.

(2) counter_derived is an int that counts how many times __init__ in the
Modular_Counter class is called (in this two-class hirerarchy, it is called
only when we construct Modular_Counter objects).

(3) __init__ initalizes each Modular_Counter object to have two pieces of state:
first, an int that remains unchanged and must be >= 1 representing the
counter's modulus; second, an int that is always (so it must start) >= 0 and
< the modulus, representing the counter's value. It verifies these properties
of modulus and init_value first, and increments counter_derived. Note that the
_value attribute is not directly defined in this __init__ methdod, but instead
is defined in the instance object when __init__ calls Counter.__init__ on this
object (which adds to its attributes). The self passed to Counter's __init__
is updated.

(4) __str__ is a query that returns a string representing the Modular_Counter
object's _value attribute, by calling Counter.__str__(self) concatenated with
the word ' mod ' and the modulus attribute.

(5) inc is a command that resets the Modular_Counter object's _value attribute
to 0 if the current value is one less than the modulus, otherwise it increments
the Modular_Counter's _value attribute by 1, by calling Counter.inc(self).

(6) value_of is a query that returns the value attribute of the Modular_Counter
object.

Generally in programming, the methods in a class should refer to a state
attribute (by a.o) ONLY IF IT IS DEFINED IN THAT SAME CLASS. That is why in
Modular_Counter's __init__, _value is not defined directly, but is instead
defined/initialized  by calling Counter's __init__; it is also why
Modular_Counter's inc method calls the inherited methods reset, inc, and
value_of, instead of directly manipulating its _value attribute.

In this approach, we consider state names to be private and should be used only
within the class that is responsible for defining and manipulating that
attribute. It is that class that ensures the integrity/invariant of that
attribute.

In contrast, generally method names are considered public and usable with any
object (unless they start with  _ or __).

Because we can refer to all the state and behavior attributes in Python, Python
programmers don't always follow this rule (although we have seen how to use
__setattr__ to disallow changing an attribute in an object). Java and C++
programmers must define each attribute as public (usable anywhere) or private
(usable only within the class in which it is defined) and the computer ensures
and enforces that private attributes are examined/changed only in the class
that defines them (there are other, more subtle options in these languages).

----------

Constructing an Object from a Derived Class

When we call Modular_Counter(0,3) -or just Modular_Counter(modulus=3)- Python
constructs an instance object whose class/type is Modular_Counter; this instance
object starts with an empty namespace (dictionary). It checks the 2 assertions
about the arguments: both are True, so Python calls
Counter.__init__(init_value).

Counter.__init__ checks its assertion: it is True, so it adds the binding _value
to the namespace of the constructed Modular_Counter object passed to self and
binds it to an int_value (here 0); it also increments Counter.counter_base: the
attribute counter_base defined in the Counter class object

Then, returning to Modular_Counter.__init__ Python adds the binding _modulus to
the namespace of the constructed Modular_Counter object (so this object now has
two attributes in its dictionary: _value and _modulus) and binds it to the
modulus (here 3); it also increments Modular_Counter.counter_derived: the
attribute counter_derived defined in the Modular_Counter class object.

So, at this point the newly constructed Modular_Counter object has two
attributes (_value (storing 0) and _modulus (storing 3)), the Counter class
object has two attributes (hierarchy_depth (storing 1) and counter_base
(storing 1), along with all its methods), and the Modular_Counter class object
has two attributes (hierarchy_depth (storing 2) and counter_derived (storing 1),
along iwth all its methods).

Note that executing x = Modular_Counter(0,3) means type(x) is Modular_Counter;
while executing x = Counter(0) means type(x) is Counter. The type function
returns the class object from which any instance object is constructed.

----------

Avoiding Infinite Recursion in Methods called defined in Derived Classes

Note carefully the __str__ method defined in the Modular_Counter class
overrides the __str__ method this class inherits from the Counter class.

    def __str__(self):
        return Counter.__str__(self)+' mod '+str(self._modulus)

Suppose we define x = Modular_Counter(0,3). Then the Fundamental Equation of
Object-Oriented Programming tells us str(x) is executed as x.str() which is
executed as type(x).__str__(x) or Modular_Counter.__str__(x). Which executes
Counter.__str__(x)+... which returns '0'+....

Now, what would happen if we instead defined

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self)+' mod '+str(self._modulus)

Now, str(x) is still executed as x.__str__() which is still executed as
type(x).__str__(x) or Modular_Counter.__str__(x). But now the body of this
function calls str(x) which is executed again as type(x).__str__(x) or
Modular_Counter.__str__(x) so we have created infinite recursion with this
change.

So generally, in a method that overrides an inherited method, if we want to
call the inherited method, we must preface it with the class in which the
inherited method is to be called. This was also done in the call to inc in the
Modular_Counter's inc method. Notice that it was not done for the call to reset,
which appears as just self.reset(); the reason is that the reset method
inherited from the Counter class is not overridden in Modular_Counter, so when
making a call to reset on a Modular_Counter object, if finds the reset attribute
note in the Modular_Counter class, but in the Counter class, so it calls that
method. This is all by the augmented Fundamental Equation of Object-Oriented
Programming rule.

Let us predict (and verify) what is printed (and why) in the following code.

c = Counter(0) 	    	    	 # OK
m = Modular_Counter(0,3)	 # OK

print(c.hiearchy_depth)		 # 1
print(c.counter_base)		 # 2 (from both c = ... and m = ...)
print(c.counter_derived)	 # AttributeError exception

print(m.hiearchy_depth)		 # 2
print(m.counter_base)		 # 2 (same as c.counter_base)
print(m.counter_derived)	 # 1 (from only m = ...)

c.inc()				 # OK
c.inc()				 # OK
c.inc()				 # OK

print(c.value_of())		 # 3
print(c.modulus_of())		 # AttributeError exception

m.inc()				 # OK
m.inc()				 # OK
m.inc()				 # OK

print(m.value_of())		 # 0
print(m.modulus_of())		 # 3

<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
In languages like Java/C++, if a class adds an attribute (state) to an object
(mostly in __init__) then only THAT class is allowed to access that state
directly as an attribute. That is, if x = C() and C's __init__ contains
self.a = ... then if another class contains any attempt to refer to x.a or 
rebind x.a (e.g., x.a = ....) it will raise an exception. Python does NOT have
this restriction, but it is still considered bad design form to write such
accesses/rebinding.

To solve this problem, each class should define methods to access/set all the
attributes it defines. That is why in there are reset/inc/value_of methods in
the Counter class: so the ModularCounter class can examine/update the _value
attribute defined in Counter. So,

1) If a class adds an attribute to an object (e.g., in __init__) then methods
defined in only that class should access the attribute directly.

2) If other classes (including derived/subclasses) need to access/update the
information stored in that attribute, then the defining class should define
methods that do the job, which the other class should call.

Some languages use the terms accessors/getters for methods that return the
value of such attributres, and mutators/setters for methods that rebind an
attribute to refer to a different value.

1) Decribes what happen using the following defintions and code

class B:
    def __init__(self):
        self.a = 1

class D:
    def __init__(self):
        self.a = 2

b = B()
d = D()
print(b.a)
print(d.a)

2) Suppose that we define the __str__ method in the Counter class to return a
string representing value as a roman numeral; what will the statments
print(Modular_Counter(2,3)) print? 

3) Suppose that we define the print_it method in the Counter class as follows:

    def print_it(self):
        print(self.__str__())

What is the result of defining c = Counter(0) and c.print_it(); same for
mc = Modular__Counter(0,3) and mc.print_it()? Does defining print_it as follows
change the result printed? Explain how each determines what value to print and
what value it prints.

    def print_it(self):
        print(str(self))


4) Define __repr__ functions in Count and Modular_Counter classes.

5) Suppose that we defined

 l = [counter(0), Modular_Counter(0,3), Modular_Counter(0,3), Counter(0)]

What would be printed if we executed the code 

for i in range(3):
    for c in l:
        c.inc()
print(l)
