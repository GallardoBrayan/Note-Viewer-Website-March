<a name="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Levels of abstraction are important in computing. We can look at a computer
(and the software it runs) at many levels of abstraction: as quantum devices
implementing logical components, as collections of these components implementing
digital circuits (described by Boolean formulas), as digital circuits combined
into an instruction set architecture (which we'll cover in today's lecture)
as an architecture capable of running "translated" computer programs written in
a high-level language, as large applications written in high-level programming
languages, and as distributed/networked applications running on multiple
machines communicating over a network.

It is difficult to hold all these levels of abstraction in our minds while we
are exploring and creating computing systems/software. We often focus on just
one level of abstraction for our jobs, while knowing some -but less- about the
levels directly below and above. We have spent most of ICS 31-33 at the level
of discussing computing via the high-level programming language Python. In this
lecture we will look down one level, at the architecture into which Python
programs are translated and run on: the Python Virtual Machine.

Some programming languages (e.g., C++) are translated into instructions that
run directly on hardware. We speak of compiling programs in that language onto
a specific hardware architecture. Other programming languages (e.g., Java and
Python) are translated to run on a common architecture: interpreters (or
virtual machines) for that architecture can be written in a low-level language
(like C, which targets most architectures) or in the machine's hardware language
itself for maximal speed, so that exactly the same translated programs can run
on any architecture that has the virtual machine program implemented on it.

The compiling approach has the advantage of producing programs that execute
speedily on real machines. But it is a large undertaking to produce a good
compiler for a new architecture, and compiling a program can take a long time.
The virtual machine approach is much easier to port to new architectures (it is
just one smallish program that must be written to run on the new architecture)
but the extra layer of software (even as well as we know how to write
interpreters) above the machine reduces performance, often by a factor 2-10 or
more. So there is no right way to write language translators: each approach
comes with its own advantages and disadvantages, and each can be used/abused in
situations.

In fact, hot-spot compilers do a bit of both. They profile programs while
interpreting them to find their hots spots (small amounts of code that are
executed frequently) and then they compile just those small pieces -all while
running the program. Language translation is and has always been an important
area in Computer Science. At UCI this topic is covered initially in
COMPSCI 142A/B: Language Processor Construction. The computer architectures for
real machines (into which compiled programs are compiled) are covered first in
ICS-51.

In this lecture we will discuss the code that Python is translated into and how
this code is run on the Python Virtual Machine. There is no way to cover this
topic fully in one lecture, so my goal is just to introduce this material and
show you an interesting vertical slice through it. We will leverage off Python's
dis.py module, whose dis function (dis means disassembly) shows us, in a
readable form, the Virtual Machine instructions that Python functions, classes,
and modules are translated into. At the very end of this lecture we will return
to analysis of algorithms by counting the instructions our Python functions are
translated into.

Finally, see Section 31.12 in the Python Library documentation for many more
details about today's lecture. Once you "get" the big picture, you might find
it quite interesting to "dis" a variety of software components. I tried to find
information about the Python Virtual Machine on the web, but it is pretty
sparse. So I put together this lecture based on general principles and the
documentation I could find. There is much more information available for the
Java virtual machine.

<a name="basics"><h1>Basics</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Every function object (what we are mostly concerned with in this lecture) is
associated with 3 tuples:

  (1) its local variable names including parameters (in .__code__.co_varnames)
  (2) its global names (in .__code__.co_names)
  (3) it constant (in .__code__.co_consts)

These tuples are built at the time Python defines the function and they are
stored in the __code__ object associated with the function.

For example, if we define

def minimum(alist):
    m = None if len(alist) == 0 else alist[0]
    for v in alist[1:]:
        if v < m:
            m = v
    return m

Then,
  minimum.__code__.co_varnames is ('alist', 'm', 'v')
  minimum.__code__.co_names is    ('len', 'None')
  minimum.__code__.co_consts is   (None, 0, 1)

Load operations (e.g., LOAD_FAST, LOAD_GLOBAL, LOAD_CONST which are all
discussed in more detail below) are followed by an integer that indexes these
tuples. So for example, in the function addup addup.__code__.co_varnames is the
list ('alist', 'sum', 'v'), so the operation LOAD_FAST  0 loads/pushes onto the
stack the value the name alist refers to. LOAD_FAST  1 loads/pushes onto the
stack the value the name sum refers to. LOAD_FAST  2 loads/pushes onto the
stack the value the name v refers to.

<a name="virtual"><h1>The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) and an example trivial calculation</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The main data structure in the PVM is the "regular" stack (which is like a
restricted a list push=append, pop=pop). A stack's primary operations are
load/push and store/pop. We load/push a value on the top of an upwardly-growing
stack (incrementing the stackp -stack pointer- that indexes the top); we
store/pop a values from the top of a stack (decrementing the stackp).

There is a secondarily important block stack that is used to store information
about nested loops, try, and with statements. For example, a break statement
is transated into code that uses the block stack to determine which loop to
break out of (and how to continue executing at the first statement outside the
loop). As loops, try/except, and with statements are started, information about
their blocks are pushed onto the block stack; as they terminate, this
information is popped off the bock stack. The block stack is too complicated
for today's lecture and is not needed to understand it: so when we run across
block stack instructions we will point out the fact that we are ignoring them.

Here is an example of a simple sequence of stack operations to perform the
calculation d = a+b*c, assuming that a, b, c, and d are local variables inside
a function: assume co_varnames is ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd') and the actual values
for these names are stored in a parallel tuple (1, 2, 3, None): e.g., the value
for 'a' is 1, the value for 'b' is 2, the value for 'c' is 3, and the value for
'd' is None. Generally the value for a name at index i in the co_varnames tuple
is stored in index i in the tuple of actual values.

As we will see in more detail below the meaning of 

  LOAD_FAST N
    load/push onto the stack the value stored in co_varnames[N],
    written stackp += 1, stack[stackp] = co_varnames[N] 

  STORE_FAST N
    store/pop the value on the top of the stack into co_varnames[N],
    written co_varnames[N] = stack[stackp], and stackp -= 1

  BINARY_MULTIPLY
    load/push onto the stack the * of the two values on the top,
    written stack[stackp-1] = stack[stackp-1] * stack[stackp]; stackp -= 1
    (turns the two values on the top of the stack into their product)

  BINARY_ADD
    load/push onto the stack the + of the two values on the top
    written stack[stackp-1] = stack[stackp-1] + stack[stackp]; stackp -= 1
    (turns the two values on the top of the stack into their sum)

The PVM code for d = a+b*c is

  LOAD_FAST 0
  LOAD_FAST 1
  LOAD_FAST 2
  BINARY_MULTIPLY
  BINARY_ADD
  STORE_FAST 3

Here is what happens step by step.

   +--------------------+
 0 |                    |
   +--------------------+
stack (with stackp = -1)

At this point d's value is 7, the value that was at the top of the stack when
STORE_FAST was executed. The actual values for these names are stored in the
tuple (1, 2, 3, 7).

Problem: show (by drawing what I drew above) how the following instructions
compute d = (a+b)*c

  LOAD_FAST 0
  LOAD_FAST 1
  BINARY_ADD
  LOAD_FAST 2
  BINARY_MULTIPLY
  STORE_FAST 3

Any expression can be translated into similar code for the PVM to evaulate its
value.

-------------------------

Control (the fetch/execute cycle) of the PVM

Each instruction (some of which are shown above) in the PVM consists of 1 or 3
bytes of information (a byte is 8 bits, and can represent numbers from 0 to
255). The first byte is the operation or byte code; the second two bytes are
the operand for that byte code (but not all byte codes require operands:
LOAD_FAST does; BINARY_ADD doesn't). Two bytes (16 bits) can represent the
numbers 0 to 65,536: so it is probably the case that Python function cannot
have more than 65,536 different local variable names.

The instructions are stored in memory: think of memory too as a kind of list
named m which stores sequential data in one location after the other. We can
illustrate this by writing the instruction sequence above as follows:

  Memory     Instruction
  Location   
--------------------------
   0         LOAD_FAST 0
   3         LOAD_FAST 1
   6         LOAD_FAST 2
   9         BINARY_MULTIPLY
  10         BINARY_ADD
  11         STORE_FAST 3

Note that the first instruction is stored in m[0], and each subsequent
instruction is stored in a location that is 3 higher (if the instruction has an
explicit operand, as the load/store instructions do; most instructions have
implicit operands: stack and pc) or 1 higher (if the instruction has no explicit
operands, as the binary operator instructions do).

Technically, the operation name (e.g., LOAD_FAST) represents a one byte value
(an integer from 0 to 255). The next two bytes are typically the higher and
lower bits in an integer between 0 and 2**16-: 65,535.

Once a program (instruction sequence) is loaded into memory, the PVM executes
it according to the following simple rules. This control/execute cycle is what
animates computers, allowing then to execute programs. It is fundamental in
Computer Science.

 (1) Fetch the operation and it operand (if present) starting at m[pc]
 (2) pc += 3 (if operand is present) or pc += 1 (if no operand is present)
 (3) Execute operation code (possibly change its operand, stack, stackp, or pc)
 (4) Go to step 1

Some operations manipulate the stack/stackp and the tuples that store values,
others can change the pc (examples of such jump instructions appear in later
sections, changing the locus of execution of the code).

So, when the pc is initially 0, the PVM executes the code above as follows

 1. fetches the operation a m[0] and the operand at m[1] and m[2]
 2. increments pc to 3
 3. manipulates the stack (see above)
 4. goes back to step 1

 1. fetches the operation a m[3] and the operand at m[4] and m[5]
 2. increments pc to 6
 3. manipulates the stack (see above)
 4. goes back to step 1

 1. fetches the operation a m[6] and the operand at m[7] and m[8]
 2. increments pc to 9
 3. manipulates the stack (see above)
 4. goes back to step 1

 1. fetches the operation a m[9]: it has no operand
 2. increments pc to 10
 3. manipulates the stack (see above)
 4. goes back to step 1

 1. fetches the operation a m[10]: it has no operand
 2. increments pc to 11
 3. manipulates the stack (see above)
 4. goes back to step 1

At this point there is no more code to execute. In the next example we will
see how the PVM executes more complicated code, specified by full Python
functions.

<a name="dis"><h1>The dis function in the dis module</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
As described briefly in the intoduction, we can print a symbolic/annotated
desciption of any Python function (and module/class too; but in this lecture
note we will stick with just functions) by using the dis function in the dis.py
module. Here "dis" means "disassemble the code in the function object into a 
form that is readable by people.

Here is an example function (with line numbers) and the result dis.dis displays
for it). All the operation codes and their meanings are covered in detail in
the next section; we will look ahead at the relevant ones.

1 def addup(alist):
2     sum = 0
3     for v in alist:
4         sum = sum + v
5    return sum

Actually, I wrote the following simple function to show useful information
about any function object (its name, its three tuples, and the dis information:)
labelled.

def func_obj(fo):
    print(fo.__name__)
    print('  co_varnames:',fo.__code__.co_varnames)
    print('  co_names   :',fo.__code__.co_names)
    print('  co_consts  :',fo.__code__.co_consts,'\n')
    print('Source Line  m  operation/byte-code      operand (useful name/number)\n'+69*'-')
    dis.dis(fo)

calling func_obj(addup) prints

addup
  co_varnames: ('alist', 'sum', 'v')
  co_names   : ()
  co_consts  : (None, 0)

Source Line  m  op/byte-code             operand (useful name/number)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (0) 
              3 STORE_FAST               1 (sum) 

  3           6 SETUP_LOOP              24 (to 33) 
              9 LOAD_FAST                0 (alist) 
             12 GET_ITER             
        >>   13 FOR_ITER                16 (to 32) 
             16 STORE_FAST               2 (v) 

  4          19 LOAD_FAST                1 (sum) 
             22 LOAD_FAST                2 (v) 
             25 BINARY_ADD           
             26 STORE_FAST               1 (sum) 
             29 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           13 
        >>   32 POP_BLOCK            

  5     >>   33 LOAD_FAST                1 (sum) 
             36 RETURN_VALUE         

Note that any line prefaced by >> means that some other instruction in the
function can jump to it (start executing code at it). Jumping in the PVM (by
setting pc) is how loops and if statements in Python do their computation.

Here is a high-level description how this function executes. For more details,
see the exact description of each instruction in the next section.

Line 2:
 m[ 0]: loads the value 0 (co_consts[1]) on the stack
 m[ 3]: stores the value 0 into sum (co_varnames[1])

Line 3:
 m[ 6]: setup for the loop by pushing the size of the loop onto the block stack
          (recall that we won't be doing anything with the block stack)
 m[ 9]: loads the value of alist (co_varnames[0]) on the stack
 m[12]: replaces its value on the stack by its iterator (by popping and pushing)
 m[13]: loads the next iterator value on the stack, jumping to m[32] if
           StopIteration raised
          (code in m[29] jumps back to this location to make the loop)
 m[16]: stores the next value into v (co_varnames[2]), popping it off the stack

Line 4:
 m[19]: loads the value of sum (co_varnames[1]) on the stack
 m[22]: loads the value of v (co_varnames[2]) on the stack
 m[25]: removes from stack/adds two values, pushes the result on the stack
 m[26]: stores the value into sum (co_varnames[1]), popping it off the stack
 m[29]: sets pc to 13, so the next instruction executed in at m[13]
          (jumps back to a previous location to make the loop loop)
 m[32]: pops what m[6] pushed onto the block stack
          (recall that we won't be doing anything with the block stack)
          (code in m[13] jumps here, on StopIteration, terminating the loop)

Line 5:
 m[33]: load the value of sum (co_varnames[1]) on the stack to return
 m[36]: return from the function with the result on the top of the stack

<a name="operate"><h1>Operation/Byte Codes</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Below is a list of many important operations and how they manipulate the PVM.
The complete list is available in section 31.12 of the Python documenation. 
Recall that many operations manipulate stack, stackp, and pc.

Loading/Storing

  LOAD_CONST   N
    stackp += 1, stack[stackp] = co_consts[N] 
  LOAD_FAST    N
    stackp += 1, stack[stackp] = co_varnames[N] 
  LOAD_GLOBAL  N
    stackp += 1, stack[stackp] = co_names[N] 
  STORE_CONST  N
    co_consts[N] = stack[stackp], and stackp -= 1
  STORE_FAST   N
    co_varnames[N] = stack[stackp], and stackp -= 1
  STORE_GLOBAL N
    co_names[N] = stack[stackp], and stackp -= 1

There are general Load and Store operations that look up names based on the
the LEGB rules, if Python is unsure where these names will be found. Generally
it uses the operations above.

There are in-place versions of the binary operators: e.g., x += 1 vs x = x + 1
I will show the meanin of INPLACE_ADD and just list the others here:

  INPLACE_ADD
    stack[stackp-1] += stack[stackp]; stackp -= 1

INPLACE_SUBTRACT, INPLACE_MULTIPLY, INPLACE_FLOOR_DIVIDE, INPLACE_TRUE_DIVIDE,
INPLACE_MODULO, INPLACE_POWER, INPLACE_LSHIFT, INPLACE_RSHIFT, INPLACE_AND,
INPLACE_XOR, and INPLACE_OR

Iteration:

  GET_ITER 
    stack[stackp] = iter(stack[stackp])
  FOR_ITER N
    stackp += 1; stack[stackp] = next(stack[stackp-1])
      but if StopIteration exception is raised in part 2: pc += N
  
Jumping (changing the pc from where the next instruction is fetched):

  JUMP_ABSOLUTE     N
    pc = N
  JUMP_FORWARD      N
    pc += N
  POP_JUMP_IF_TRUE  N
    if stack[stackp] is True, pc = N (always stackp =- 1)
  POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE N
    if stack[stackp] is False, pc = N (always stackp =- 1)

Calling Functions and Returning/Yielding
  CALL_FUNCTION N
    The first operand byte is a count of the position arguments: pcount
    The second operand byte is a count of the keyword arguments: kcount
    There are kcount values on the top of the stack followed by pcount values
      followed by the function to call
    This operation pops all function arguments off the stack to store them into
      the co_varnames tuple, and pops off the the function itself
    The function should leave its answer on the top of the stack

  RETURN_VALUE
    Return to the location that called this function (its retuned answer on the
      top of the stack)

  YIELD_VALUE

In the Library Reference, they use the notation TOS to mean the location at
the top of the stack, and TOSn to mean n down from the top of the stack. So
TOS is our stack[stackp] and TOS1 is our stack[stackp-1]

Here is a slightly more interesting function. It contains both a conditional/if
statement (lines 4-5) and a conditional expression (line 6), which translate
into a variety of jump instructions. Also note how the tuple assignment in line
2 is translated via the UNPACK_SEQUENCE N instruction (which takes any sequence
of values (tuple or list) and pushes N of them onto the stack right to left:
so if (0,1) is on the stack, UNPACK_SEQUENCE 2 pops this value off the stack,
pushing first 1 then 0 onto the stack (which is why the first value below is
stored into sum and the second is stored into count).

1 def average_positive(alist):
2    sum,count = 0,0
3    for v in alist:
4        if v > 0:
5            sum = sum + v
6            count += 1
7    return sum / (1 if count == 0 else count)

Please feel free to type in all sorts of small functions to see how they are
translated to run on the PVM. The project folder that you can download includes
some simple functions and the func_obj function.

Note that the two simple functions shown did not call functions on their inside:
see addup1 in the project folder, which uese range and len to iterate of the
list indexes to compute the sum. The relevant line in the function is

    for i in range(len(alist)):

The local/global names are

  co_varnames: ('alist', 'sum', 'i')
  co_names   : ('range', 'len')

and sequence of instructions is

              9 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (range) 
             12 LOAD_GLOBAL              1 (len) 
             15 LOAD_FAST                0 (alist) 
             18 CALL_FUNCTION            1 (1 positional, 0 keyword pair) 
             21 CALL_FUNCTION            1 (1 positional, 0 keyword pair) 
             24 GET_ITER             
        >>   25 FOR_ITER                20 (to 48) 
             28 STORE_FAST               2 (i) 

Here the range function, to call last, is loaded/pushed on the stack; then the
len function, to call first, is loaded/pushed on the stack; then the alist
variable is pushed on the stack. The stack looks as follows

         ....
   +--------------------+
 3 |                    |
   +--------------------+
 2 | alist value        |
   +--------------------+
 1 | len function       |
   +--------------------+
 0 | range function     |
   +--------------------+
stack (with stackp = 2)

The first CALL_FUNCTION 1 says using 1 positional argument (stackp=2), call the
function specified at stackp-1 (len) on the stack, leaving the answer on the
stack. The stack looks as follows

         ....
   +--------------------+
 3 |                    |
   +--------------------+
 2 |                    |
   +--------------------+
 1 | len(alist) value   |
   +--------------------+
 0 | range function     |
   +--------------------+
stack (with stackp = 1)

The second CALL_FUNCTION 1 says using 1 positional argument (stackp=1), call the
function specified at stackp-1 (range) on the stack, leaving the answer on the
stack. The stack looks as follows

         ....
   +--------------------+
 3 |                    |
   +--------------------+
 2 |                    |
   +--------------------+
 1 |                    |
   +--------------------+
 0 | range(len(alist))  | The range iterator 
   +--------------------+
stack (with stackp = 1)

Then GET_ITER is called to do the iteration, which uses FOR_ITER to produce
the first value (which is stored in local variable i).

We can use the result of dis to compute the worst case count of the numnber of
instructions executed in a function. Let's return to (and review) the addup
function for our analysis.

3     for v in alist:
4         sum = sum + v
5    return sum

             16 STORE_FAST               2 (v) 

  4          19 LOAD_FAST                1 (sum) 
             22 LOAD_FAST                2 (v) 
             25 BINARY_ADD           
             26 STORE_FAST               1 (sum) 
             29 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           13 
        >>   32 POP_BLOCK            

  5     >>   33 LOAD_FAST                1 (sum) 
             36 RETURN_VALUE         

Here is how to account for the number of instructions executed when Python runs
this function. As always we will assume that the len(alist) is N. Here there are
no conditional statements so the worst case always executes all the code in the
function (and the loop N times).

Instructions done once (not in the loop proper)
  2 for line 2, code before the loop: initialize sum
  3 for line 3, setup for the loop; not repeated in the loop proper at m[13]
  1 for line 4, at m[32], jumped to when StopIteration exception is raised
  2 for line 5, code after the loop: load/push sum on the stack and return

Instructions done in the loop
  2 for line 3, m[13] and m[16]; note loop back to m[13]
  5 for line 4, sum = sum + v and jump back to m[13] to get next iterator value

Finally, note that the instruction at m[13] is executed N+1 times: N times it
continues in the loop body and 1 time it raises StopIteration and jumps to
m[32].

So, the I(N) is 8 (instructions done once) + 7N (instructions done in the loop)
 + 1 (m[13] done on N+1 iteration raising StopInteration) instructions.

I(N) = 7N + 9 instructions
