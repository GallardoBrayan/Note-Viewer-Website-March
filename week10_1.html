<a name="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
In this lecture we will explore a bit of the Java language: I chose Java
because I know it better than C++ (both, like Python, are still changing and
evolving). The main point of this lecture is to show a more conventional
language similar to Python (still in the same general family: object-oriented
languages that use statements to compute their results) but with some
differences.

I have tried to discuss the most important and interesting differences between
these language, broadly broken into four main areas.

  1) Compilation and compile-time vs. run-time issues
  2) Syntax differences
  3) Static vs dynamic typing
  4) Built-in vs Class Supplied Data Structures

Note that you all should have Java installed on your computers (to run Eclipse)
so you can use Eclipse to write and run Java programs.
</pre>

<a name="compilation"><h1>Compilation</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
As with Python, Java translates programs into a special instruction set that
runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In fact, the JVM is so well-known that
other languages are translated to run on the JVM. Java programs run 5 times as
fast as Python programs (and C++ programs run another factor of 5 faster) but
with a price: there are important Python programming features (e.g., eval and
exec) that Java does not support (and likewise, C++ doesn't support certain
features that makes checking/debugging Java programs easier*). So this is an
example of languages trading-off power and ease of programming for speed of
execution. 

-----
*For example, Python checks its lists (and Java its arrays) for indexes that
are out of bounds, and raises an exception. Typically it reports an illegal
index error at run-time (Java further reports the illegal index used; Python
just says the index is illegal without reporting its value). When an illegal
index is used with a C++ array, typically there is no runtime error: instead
C++ just uses the information in its memory where the value at the illegal
index would appear if it were in the array; what is actually there, in the
computer's memory, is some random values. So the program keeps running,
although it is likely the bad data will corrupt the computation. By avoiding
checking indexes, C++ allows correct programs (e.g., ones doing no illegal
indexing) to run faster. But incorrect programs don't fail when the error
occurs: instead they keep excuting and maybe fail later, but often instead
print wrong results (or worse, incorrectly buy/sell a stock, or
catastrophically decide to launch a nuclear attack, because of an incorrect
program).
-----

Python reads and translates imported modules on the fly, while it is runing
programs. Java breaks running programs into two separate processes: compiling
programs first (translating them into JVM instructions) and then running these
instructions on the JVM. Errors are categorized as to when they occur: at
compile-time or at run-time. The program that does the compilation is called
the Java Compiler.

Certain Java errors are called syntax or compile-time errors; others are called
execution or run-time errors. Actually Python has the concept of syntax errors
(even if there is no separate compile-time/run-time distinction). For example
in Python, if we misspell a keyword or name, or indent a block incorrectly,
Python reports the error, but only when we run the program; although the
Eclipse editor often flags such errors for us before we run our program:
indicating that if we run it, Python will find an error. Likewise, when Java
compiles a program, Java checks it for the same kinds of errors (and more; see
below). But, we cannot run Java software until all its files compile correctly.

<a name="important"><h1>Important Syntactic Differences</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Python and Java are similar languages in that both define statements that are
executed in sequences known as blocks. The syntax of Python requires that each
statement is on a different line and that blocks are indented. The syntax of
Java requires that statements are separated by semicolons (so one can easily
have multiple statements per line or one statement covering multiple blocks)
and that blocks (of more than one statement) must appear in the {} braces. Java
promotes a certain format for writing blocks (so that the code is clearly
indented and actually looks like Python code) but such style rules are not
required of programmers writing in the language. In fact, style rules for 
Java and C++ are a bit different.

Python	   	     	 Java

if x < y:		 if (x < y) {
    min = x		     min = x;
    max = y		     max = y
else:	  		 }else{
    min = y		     min = y;
    max = x		     max = x
                         }

Note that the syntax of Java requires () parentheses in more places than Python
does: like surrounding the test in an if (or while) statement. Also note that
we can write this Java code as

if (x < y) {min = x; max = y}else{min = y; max = x}

and it has the same meaning to the Java compiler. Even the following code
(indented nonsensically)

if (x < y)
{min = x;
    max = y}
  else{min
= y; max
   = x}

has the same meaning. A program is just a sequence of tokens. We can write the
Python code on the left as either Java code on the right: the first uses one
statements in the if/else; the second uses blocks (containing one statement).
Note the meaning of / in Java: int/int in Java is like int//int in Python.

if x%2 == 0:		if (x%2 == 0)		  if (x%2 == 0) {
    x = x//2                x = x / 2                 x = x /2
else:                   else			  }else{
    x = 3*x + 1             x = 3*x + 1		      x = 3*x + 1

Names in Java are written in "camel" notation. In Python we wrote a_var_name
and in Java we write aVarName (the capital letters are like humps on a Camel).
By Java convention, most names start with a lower-case letter, but class names
start with an upper-case letter.

Here is an minor but interesting difference: Python interprets the expression
a < b < c as a < b and b < c. Java interprets this expression as a < b < c to
compare the boolean result of the first < to c, which is likely to cause a
static-typing compilation error described below. In Java we must write
a < b < c more explicitly, as a < b && b < c (where && is Java's equivalent to
Python's and operator).

For commenting // is used in Java is like # is use in Python, as a
line-oriented comment. Java also has multiline comments
such as 

/*
   This is a multi-line
   comment in Java
*/

In Python, files contain modules or classes. In Java there is no equivalent to
modules, so files contain only classes, one class per file. The name of file
and the name of the class it contains must be the same. So everything that we
write in Java we write in some class: there is a special method named "main" in
a class which Java calls to start a program executing (similar to Python, in
which we write code in a module like if __name__ == '__main__':).

Note that Java divides types into primitive and reference types. Primitive
types are things like integers (ints) and floating point values (double).
References store references to objects constructed from classes (just like
Python). In fact there are classes like Int and Double that are the equivalent
of the primitive types: they are more cumbersome and slower to use, but we can
use them in places where class objects must be used (not primitives: there are
a few rough corners like this). Java operators work primarily on primitive
types; reference types use methods to perform computations. Java classes cannot
overload operators the way Python does (but C++ can).

Java allows only single inheritance. Classes can refer to information
in their super classes by using the keyword super. So if the inc method in the
Modular_Counter subclass (as they are know in Java, the same as a derived class
in Python) overrides the inc method in its Counter superclass (the same as a
base class in Python) the inc method in Modular_Counter can call super.inc() to
call the inc method in Counter. In Python we would write Counter.inc() instead.

<div class="top"><h4><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></h4></div>

<a name="static"><h1>Static and Dynamic Typing (relating to the types of values)</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Python is a dynamically typed language. Java (and C++) is a statically typed
language. In a dynamically typed language, each name refers to an object that
is of some type, but we cannot always know what type that is. For one example
we can write x = 1 and later x = [1,2,3] so x first refers to an int and later
a list of ints.*

-----
*Note that ints in Java are 32 bit quantities, not arbitrarily sized integers
as in Python. Java does have a type name BigInt that stores arbitrarily large
integers, but is a class we must operate on it with methods. So we end up
writing code like x = BigInteger("2984248239834923"); y = x.multiply(x).add(x)
(which in Python we would write as just x = 2984248239834923 and  y = x*x+x)
Recall that operators in Java generally work only on the primitive types. We
cannot write classes that overload operators in Java as we did in Python (but
can overload operators in C++)
-----

For another example, if we define

def randtype():
    if random.random() < .5:
        return 1
    else:
        return 1.

x = randtype()

Then we don't know what type of object the name x refers to: it might be int or
it might be float. But we can compute type(x) to find out. So, in a dynamically
typed language when we define names we don't need to specify their type: we
assign them a reference to a value. Not knowing the type of value associated
with a name (and having to compute it at run-time) is another reason Python
runs more slowly than Java and C++. Whenever Python must do something with the
value associated with a name, it must first compute its type: think of the
fundamental equation of object-oriented programming.

In a statically typed language like Java, we must specify the type of each
name: in Java we talk about declaring (not defining names). We can write either
int x; or int x = 1; the former declares x to always store an int but currently
store no value, while the latter declares x to always store an int and
currently store 1. 

So, we must specify the type of parameters and local variables; we also must
specify the return type of any method, where the type name void means that it
returns no value: Python functions returning None is a different but similar
idea to Java methods having a void return type: note that there are no pure
"functions" in Java in the Python sense, there are only methods; but static
methods in Java are most like pure functions in Python, because we can call
them by specifying the class and method name, much like importing a Python
module and using the module and its function name. So we might see a method
defined in the Math class by

static int factorial (int n) {
    int answer = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i< n; i++)
        answer *= i;
    return answer
}

and call it by Math.factorial(5).

Here n, answer, and i are all declared to be int, and the method also returns
an int. Notice the for loop which has a variable declaration/initialization
(int i = 1), followed by a continuation test (i< n), followed by an increment
(i++ which means i += 1). Notice how {} contains the block that is the body of
this method. The for loop has just one statement in its body, so we do not need
a block.

Once Java knows variable names and their types, and the parameter/return types
of functions (and of course it knows the types of all its constants) it can
determine the type of any expression using operators and functions, and it can
determine any type mismatches at compile time. For example, if we have defined

double  d(int x) ...
double d2(double x)
int     i(int x) ...
int x;

Then the Java compiler knows

 x = d(3) results in type mismatch: the d function takes an int as an argument
(3 is an int) and produces a double, but the type of x is an int, so there is a
type mismatch reported by the compiler: it cannot assign a double value to an
int name.

Likewise, calling i(d(3)) results in a type mistmatch: the d function takes 
an int as an argument (3 is an int) and produces a double, but the i function
takes an int as an argument, but d(3) is a double, so there is a type mismatch
reported by the compiler.

Generally, if we try to assign a value of one type to a name declared to be of
another type, Java reports a compile-time error. Likewise, if we try to pass
an argument of one type to a parameter name declare to be of another type, Java
reports a compile-time error.*

-----
*Certain implicit type conversions, called promotions, automatically occur to
"solve" some type mismatches. For example, if we call d2(i(3)) Java will allow
it:  the i function takes an int as an argument (3 is an int) and produces an
int, but the d2 function takes a double as an argument, so Java will implicitly
promote the int to its equivalent double. This promotion works because every
int can be converted into a double with the same value (note that for doubles
this is not the case: there is no int value equivalent to 1.5.

There is a way to convert a double into an int by throwing away its decimal
part. This is called casting, and we can write i((int)(d(3)) for which Java
does not report a  type mismatch. Likewise we can avoid implicit conversion by
explicitly converting with casting, as in d2((double)i(3)).
-----

Note that in Python we can specify a parameter that expects an int values but
has a default value of None (two different types). For example, if we define

def f(max=None): .... 

we can call f(1) where max = 1 or f() where max = None.

Java does not allow this kind of function, because we cannot have a parameter
that is sometimes an int and sometimes None. But it makes up by allowing us to
define two version of f (with two different parameter structures)

... f(int max ) {...}
... f()         {...}

Now if we call f(1) it executes the first function with max = 1; if we call f()
it executes the second function.

Note that Python annotations CAN play a SIMILAR roll to static typing but with
a large time cost at runtime. Generally, annotations are just ignored. We have
seen that we can write a function decorator and turn on annotation checking.
This means that every time a Python function is called it checks all the values
of its parameters (and possibly its return value). This checking takes place at
run-time, and can take a long time when checking large data structures.
Contrast this approach with Java's, where it performs all its checking once, at
compile-time: there is an increased compile-time cost, but no run-time cost.

So overall, it is harder to get a Java program to compile, because the compiler
is checking for type compatability. But when a Java program compiles correctly,
when it is run it will never report the kinds of incompatible type errors that
appear frequently in Python. So if we code a type error, we must fix it in Java
and Python, but the Java compiler will report the problem (and the statement
causing it) at compile-time, before running the program. Python will run the
program and only then report the problem at run-time. So by providing type
information to the compiler, it can check that we using names in approprate
ways.

Interfaces specify the parameter/return types of one or more methods in a
class. Classes can specify that they implement any number of interfaces (so
long as they define the methods with the required parameter/return types).
Implementing multiple interfaces is similar to multiple inheritance (it is more
restrictive but cleaner).

We can use the names of interfaces to specify a type: objects of any class
implementing that interface are allowed to match it.

If we specify

interface LikeBoolean {
  boolean bool();
}

Then if we define a class C and specify it implements LikeBoolean, and we
declare LikeBoolean c = C(..) we can call c.bool() which returns a boolean
value representing the object of class C that c refers to. We can pass an
object of class C as the first argument to the following method (note that in
Java a ? b : c in Java is like the conditional expression b if a else c 
in Python).

int choose(LikeBoolean lb, int trueV, int falseV) {
  return lb.bool() ? trueV : falseV
}

So choose(c,1,0) would return 1 if c.bool() were true and 0 if c.bool() were
false (in Java, the boolean values are true/false not True/False).

If class D also implements LikeBoolean, then we can also pass an object of
class D to choose. So choose(d,1,0) would return 1 if d.bool() were true and
0 if d.bool() were false.

So by using interfaces, we specify the argument matching the parameter lb can
be an object constructed from any class, so long as that class implements the
LikeBoolean interface: meaning the class defines a bool method, which is the
only method choose calls on its lb parameter.

Finally, the types of names can be prefaced by attributes like public and
private, determining whether the name can be referred to in code outside the
class (public) or can be acccessed only in methods inside the class (private).
Java does this cleanly; we saw ways some ways to gain this control in Python
by overloading special __...__ methods.

<a name="built"><h1>Built-in vs Class Supplied Data Structures</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Java builds-in the primitive types and references. One other built-in type is
arrays: which are like lists, but cannot grow. When we allocate an array object
we must specify its length. We can use less than its length, but if we need to
use more we must allocate a new/bigger array and then copy all the values from
the old array to the new one. Arrays in Java are homogenous: they store the
same type of value in each spot. Although, with interfaces and the use of
inheritance, values constructed from many different classes can be stored in an
array. We can declare and construct array objects like int [] i = new int[10]
or LikeBoolean[] lb = new LikeBoolean[10]. Here, read int[] as int array and
new int[10] constructs an array of 10 int objects. As described earlier,
accessing an array out of bounds: using a negative index or an index >= the
arrays's length (given in Java by writing x.length), is checked and raises an
exception.

Note that the compiler allows us to call lb[5].bool() because each value in
the lb array is of type LikeBoolean, and we can call .bool() on any value of
the LikeBoolean type (based on the interface specifying that method).

Java has an isinstance function that can determine whether a value comes from
a specific type (or any of its subclasses).

Unlike Python, Java does not build in lists, sets, or dictionaries. But its
standard library includes interfaces that describe these data types and
classes (sometimes multiple classes) that implement these interfaces. The
interfaces are List, Set, and Map (which is like a dictionary, mapping a key
to a value) and example classes that we can use that implement these interfaces
interfaces, are ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap.

Because these data structures are supplied as classes, there is no special
syntax for using them (e.g., no {} to create maps or [] to access/set maps).
So instead of code like graph[source] we must write graph.get(source). And
instead of graph[from] = destinations we must write
graph.put(from,destintations)

Some people say, it is "only syntax". But it does make codes a bit harder to
read, understand, and write, especially when the key/value is more complicated.

I don't have enough time to go into how these classes are used, but here is
Java code that solves the Reachability problem from Programming Assignment #1
in ICS-33. Note that Map<String,Set<String>> (for defininig the graph) defines
a type which is a Map from String to a Set containing String. If we were to try
to put a key or associated value in the map that violated these type
specification is, the Java compiler would detect and report an error at
compile-time.
