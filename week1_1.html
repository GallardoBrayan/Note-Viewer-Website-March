<a name="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
When reading the following material, I suggest that you have Eclipse open,
including a project with an empty module; then copy/paste some of the code
below into it, to see what it does. Explore the code by experimenting with
(changing) it and predicting what results from the changes. I always have an
Eclipse folder/module named "experiment" open for this purpose.

This lecture note is long (it is really three lectures), but the information is
not deep (for ICS-31/ICS-32 graduates). I hope that this is mostly review for
you, but there are likely to be many things that come up as new (or a few new
perspectives and connections to the material you already know). Pay close
attention to the terminology used here, as I will use it (I hope consistently)
throughout the entire quarter. If you do not know any of these technical terms,
try looking them up online, or post a message on the "Lecture Material"
MessageBoard Forum: if you didn't understand a term, probably other students
didn't as well. Here are 3 quotes relevant to this lecture:

  1) The first step towards wisdom is calling things by their right names.

  2) He/She who is ashamed of asking is ashamed of learning.

  3) The voyage of discovery is not in seeking new landscapes but in having new
     eyes. - M. Proust

		<a name="binding"><h1>Binding</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">The process of making a name refer to a value: e.g., x = 1 binds the name x to
the value 1 ((which is an object/instance of the int class); later we can bind
x to another value (possibly from another class) in another assignment: e.g.,
x = 'abc'. We speak about "the binding (noun) of a name" to mean the value
(such values are always objects) that the name is currently associated with.

In Python, every data instance, module, function, and class is objects that has
a dictionary that stores its namespace: all its bindings. We will learn much
more about namespaces (and how to manipulate them) later in the quarter, when we
study classes in more detail.

Typically we illustrate the binding of a name to an object (below, x = 1) as
follows. We write the name over a rectangle, in which the tail of an arrow is
INSIDE, specifying the current reference stored for that name: the arrow's head
refers to a rounded-edge rectangle object labeled by its type (here the class
it is constructed from) and its value (inside).

  x          int
+---+	    (---)
| --+------>| 1 |
+---+	    (---)

Technically, if we we write x = 1 inside the module m, Python has already
created an object for module m (we show all objects as rounded-edge rectangles)
and it puts x, its box, and its binding in the namespace of module m: here, the
name x is defined inside module m and bound to object 1. That is, we would more
formally write the result of x = 1 in module m as

             module
          (---------)
  m       |    x    |      int
+---+     |  +---+  |     (---)
| --+---->|  | --+--+---->| 1 |
+---+     |  +---+  |     (---)
          (---------)

Note that the del command in Python (e.g., del name) removes a name from the
namespace/dictionary of the object in which name is bound. Writing del x
inside module m would remove x and its box from m's namspace/dictionary.

Finally, the "is" operator in Python determines whether two references refer to
the same object; the == operator determines whether two references refer to
objects that store the same internal state. If a is b is True then a== b must
be True (because an object has the same state as itself).

If we write

  x = ['a','b']
  y = ['a','b']
  
then x is y is False and x == y is True: the names x and y are bound to/refer
to two different list objects, but these two objects store the same state ('a'
at index 0; 'b' at index 1).

                list
            (-----------)
  x         |   0   1   |        str
+---+	    | +---+---+ |       +---+
| --+------>| | | | --+-+-----> |'b'|
+---+	    | +-+-+---+ |	+---+
	    (---+-------)
                |
		v
	       str		
	      +---+
	      |'a'|
	      +---+

                list
            (-----------)
  y         |   0   1   |        str
+---+	    | +---+---+ |       +---+
| --+------>| | | | --+-+-----> |'b'|
+---+	    | +-+-+---+ |	+---+
	    (---+-------)
                |
		v
	       str		
	      +---+
	      |'a'|
	      +---+



Likewise, if we write

  x = ['a','b']
  y = x

then x is y is True (and x == y is therefore True): the names x and y refer to
the same list object.
  x
+---+           list
| --+------>(-----------)
+---+       |   0   1   |        str
            | +---+---+ |       +---+
  y         | | | | --+-+-----> |'b'|
+---+	    | +-+-+---+ |	+---+
| --+------>(---+-------)
+---+           |
		v
	       str		
	      +---+
	      |'a'|
	      +---+

You should be able to draw simple picture of these names and objects (both the
list and int objects) to illustrate the difference between the "is" and ==
operators.

	<a name="statements"><h1>Statements vs Expressions</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
			Statement are executed to cause an effect (e.g., binding/rebinding a name or
producing output). Expressions are evaluated to compute a result (e.g.,
computing some formula, numeric, boolean, etc.). For example, the statement
x = 1, when executed, causes a binding of the name x to an object representing
the integer 1. The expression x+1, when evaluated, computes the object
representing the integer 2. Typically we write expressions inside statements:
two examples are x = x+1 and print(x+1): both "do something" with the computed
value (the first binds x to it; the second prints it). The distinction between
statements and expressions is important in most programming languages. 

Control structures (even simple sequential ones, like blocks) are considered
to be statements in Python (and Python has rules for how to execute them).
Control structures might contain both statements and expressions. The following
is a conditional statement using if/else

  if x == None:
      y = 0
  else:
      y = 1

This if statement contains the expression x == None and the statements y = 0 and
y = 1.

The following statement includes a conditional expression that binds a value to
y: the conditional expression includes the expressions 0 (yes, an object by
itself, or just a name referting to an object, is an expression), x == None,
and 1.

  y = (0 if x == None else 1)

We will discuss conditional statements vs. conditional expressions in more
detail later in this lecture note.

	<div class="top"><h4><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></h4></div>

	<a name="none"><h1>None</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
None is a value (object/instance) of NoneType it is the only value of that type.
Sometimes None gets used as a default value for a parameter's argument;
sometimes it gets used as a return value of a function: a Python function that
terminates without executing a return statement automatically returns the value
None. If None shows up as an unexpected result printed in your code or in a 
raised exception, look for some function whose return value you forgot to
specify explicitly (or whose return statement somehow didn't get executed).
		</pre>
	<div class="top"><h4><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></h4></div>

	<a name="pass"><h1>Pass</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
pass is the simplest statement in Python; semantically, it means "do nothing".
Sometimes when we write statements, we aren't sure exactly which ones to write,
so we migh use pass as a placeholder until we write the actual statement we
need. Often, in tiny examples, we use pass as the meaning of a function.

  def f(x) : pass     or     def f(x) :
      	     	      	         pass

If you are ever tempted to write the first if statement below, don't; instead
write the second one, which is simpler: but, they are equivalent.

  if a in s:			# DON'T write this code
      pass
  else:
      print('a is not in s')


  if a not in s:		# Write this code instead; it is equivalent
      print('a is not in s')

	<div class="top"><h4><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></h4></div>

	<a name="importing"><h1>Importing: 5 Forms</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
There are five import forms; you should know what each does, and start to think
about which is appropriate to use in any given situation. Note we will soon
learn EBNF and see that [...] means option and {...}  means repeat 0 or more
times, although this second form is sometimes written (...)* when describing
Python syntax.

Fundamentally, import statements bind names to objects (one or both of which
come from the imported module).

"import module-name" form:
  1. import module-name{,module-name}
  2. import module-name [as alt-name] {,module-name [as alt-name]}

"from module-name import" form:
  1. from module-name import attr-name{,attr-name}
  2. from module-name import attr-name [as alt-name] {,attr-name [as alt-name]}
  3. from module-name import *

Above, alt-name is an alternative name, and attr-name is an attribute name
already defined in the namespace of the module being imported.

The "import module-name" forms import the names of modules (not their attribute
names). (1) bind each module-name to the object representing that imported
module-name. (2) bind each alt-name to the object representing its preceding
imported module-name.

The "from module-name import" forms don't import module-name, but instead
import some/all names defined/bound inside module-name. (1) bind each attr-name
to the object bound to that attr-name in module-name. (2) bind each alt-name to
the object bound to the preceding attr-name in module-name. (3) bind each name
that is bound in module-name to the same object it is bound to in module-name.

Import (like an assignment, def, and class) creates a name (if that name is not
already in the namespace) and binds it to an object: the "import module-name"
form binds names to module objects; the "from module-name import" form binds
names to objects (instances, functions, modules, classes, etc.) defined inside
modules (so now two modules containse names bound to the same objects).

The key idea as to which kind of import to use is to make it easy to refer to a
name but not pollute the name space of the module doing the importing with too
many names.

If a lot of different names in the imported module are to be used, or we want
to make it clear when an attribute name in another module is used, use the
"import module-name" form (1) and then qualify the names when used: for example

  import random
  # use:  random.choice(...)  and  random.randint(...)

If the imported module-name is too large for using repeatedly, use an
abbreviaton by importing using an alt-name (2) : for example

  import high_precision_math as hp_math
  # use:  hp_math.sqrt(...)

If only one name (or a few names) are to be used from a module, use the
form (3):

  from random import choice, randint
  # use: choice(...)  and  randint(...)

Again, use alt-name to simplify either form, if the name is too large and
unwieldy to use. Such names are often very long to be clear, but awkward to use
many times at that length. Generally we should apply the Goldilocks principle:
name lengths shouldn't be too short (devoid of meaning) or too long (awkward to
read/type) but their length should be "just right".

We almost never write the * form of importing. It imports all the names defined
in module-name, and pollutes our namespace by defining all sorts of names we
may or may not use (and which might conflict with names that we have already
defined). Better to explicitly import the names needed/used. Eclipse marks with
a warning any names that are imported but unused.

	<a name="literation"><h1>Directly iterating over values in a list vs. Using a range to iterate over indexes of values in a list</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We know that we can iterate (with a for loop) over ranges: e.g., if alist is a
list, we can write

alist = [5, 2, 3, 1, 4, 0]
for i in range(0,len(alist)): # same as    for i in range(len(alist)):
    print(alist[i])

Here i takes on the values 0, 1, ... , len(alist)-1 but not len(alist), which
is 6. The code above prints all six values in alist: alist[0], alist[1], ....
alist[5].

Often we want to iterate over the values in a list (alist) but don't need to
know/use  their indexes at all: e.g., to print all the values in a list we can
use the loop

for x in alist:
    print(x)

which is much better (simpler/clearer) than the loop

for i in range(0,len(alist)):
    print(alist[i])

although both produce the same result. Generally, choose to write the simplest
loop possible for all your code. Sometimes you might write a loop correctly, but
then realize that you can also write a simpler loop correctly: change your code
to the simpler loop. Sometimes (when doing more complicated index processing)
we need to iterate over indexes.

In many cases where using range is appropriate, we want to go from the low to
high value inclusively. I have written function named irange (for inclusive
range) that we can import from the goody module and use like range.

from goody import irange
for i in irange(1,10):
    print(i)

prints the values 1 through 10 inclusive; range(1,10) would print only 1
through 9. One goal for ICS-33 is to show you how to write alternatives to
built-in Python features; we will study how irange is written later in quarter,
but you can import and use it now.

	<div class="top"><h4><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></h4></div>

	<a name="argP"><h1>Arguments and Parameters (and Binding): Terminology (much more details later)</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Whenever we DEFINE a function (and later methods in classes), we specify the
names of its parameters in its header (in parentheses, separated by commas).
Whenever we CALL a function we specify the values of its arguments (also in
parentheses, separated by commas). The definition below

def f(x,y):
    return x**y

defines a function of two parameters: x and y. f(5,2*6) calls this function with
two arguments: the arguments 5 and 2*6 are evaluated (producing objects) and
the values/objects computed from these arguments (5 and 12) are bound to their
matching parameters in the function header (and then the body of the function
is executed). We will discuss the details of argument/parameter binding in much
more detail below, but in a simple example like this one, parameter/argument
binding is like writing: x,y = 5,2*6 which binds x to 5 and y to 12.

Sometimes we can use the parameter of a function as an argument to another
function call inside its body. If we define

def factorial_sum(a,b):
    return factorial(a) + factorial(b)

Here the parameters a and b of factorial_sum function are used as arguments in
the two calls to the factorial function.

It is important that you understand the distinction between the technical term
PARAMETER and ARGUMENT, and that calling a function first binds the parameter
names to their associated argument values in the functon's HEADER (we will
discuss the exact rules soon) and then executes the BODY of the function.
		</pre>
	<div class="top"><h4><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></h4></div>

	<a name="functioncalls"><h1>Function calls ... always include ()</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Any time a reference to an object is followed by (...) it means to perform a
function call on that object (some objects will raise an exception if they do
not support function calls: writing 3() or 'abc'() will both raise exceptions).
While this rule is simple to understand for the functions that you have been
writing and calling, there are some much more interesting ramifications of this
simple rule. Run the following code to define these three functions.

def double(x):
    return 2*x

def triple(x):
    return 3*x

def magnitude(x):
    return 10*x

Note that each def defines the name of a function and binds that name to the
function object that follows it.

If we wrote

f = double

then f would become a defined name bound to the same (function) object that the
name double is bound to. The expression "f is double" would evaluate to True,
because these two names are bound to the same object. Note that there are no ()
in the code above, so there is no function call. If we then write

print( f(5) )

Python would print 10, just as it would if we printed double(5), because f and
double refer to the same function object, and it makes no difference whether we
call that function object using f or double. The function call does not occur
until we use (). Of course the () in print(...) means that the print function is
also called: it is called on the result returned by calling f(5). So the two
sets of () in th print( f(5) ) means that Python calls two functions.

Here is a more intersting example, but using exactly the same idea.

for f in [double, triple, magnitude]:
    print( f(5) )

Here f is a variable that iterates through the values in a list (we could also
have used a tuple): each value in the list is a reference to a function object
(the objects referred to by the names double, triple, and magnitude). This code
prints the values computed by calling each of these function objects with the
argument 5. Note that these functions are NOT called when creating the list (no
parentheses there!): the list is just built to contain references to these
three function objects: again, their names are not followed by () so there is
no function call. This code prints 10, 15, and 50.

Using the same logic, we could also write a dictionary whose keys are strings
and whose values are function objects, and then use a string as a key needed to
retrieve and call its associated function object.

fs = {'2x' : double, '3x' : triple, '10x' : magnitude}
print( fs['3x'](5) )

Here fs is a dictionary that stores keys that are strings and associates each
with a function object: there are no calls to functions when building the
dictionary for fs in the first statement - no (); we then can retrieve the
function associated with any key (here the key '3x') and then call the resulting
function object (here fs['3x']) with the argument 5. Of course in the second
statement we use the () to call the function selected from the dictionary.

	<div class="top"><h4><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></h4></div>

	<a name="legb"><h1>Function calls can return references to function objects,
   which are executed using the LEGB rule for bindings</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Look at the following function named bigger_than, which is a function of one
parameter. Inside, it defines a local function named test which also has one
parameter, then the bigger_than function returns a reference to the test
function object that it defines. Have you seen functions that return functions
before? This is powerful programming feature.

def bigger_than(v) :
    def test(x) :
        return x > v
    return test

Note that the inner function (test) can refer to global names (defined in the
module) and any local names defined in the outer function (bigger_than): here
test refers to its own local parameter name (x) and to the parameter name (v)
defined if the bigger_than function. Generally when Python looks up the binding
of any name, it uses the LEGB rule, finding the object bound to the name using
the following ordering.

  (1) Look for the name Locally (parameter/local variable) in the function:   L
  (2) Look for the name in an Enclosing function:                             E
  (3) Look for the name Globaly (defined in the module outside the function): G
  (4) Look for the name in the Builtins module (imported automatically):      B

When we call bigger_than we execute its body, which creates a NEW function
object bound to test; that function object can refer to v, which is a parameter
bound to the argument passed to the call of bigger_than. Then the return
statement returns a reference to that new function object.

Now, we can write the following

old     = bigger_than(60)
ancient = bigger_than(90)
print (old(10), old(70), old(90), ancient(70), ancient(95))

Python prints

False True True False True

Each assignment statement binds its name (old and ancient) to a different
function object that is returned by calling the bigger_than function. Each
function object remembers in v the argument used to call bigger_than. Then,
when we call each function, it uses the remembered value for v to compute its
result.

In fact, we even could even have written something like

print ( bigger_than(60)(70) )

We know that bigger_than(60) calls bigger_than with the argument 60, which
returns a result that is a reference to its inner function test; by writing (70)
after that, we are again just calling a function: that inner function object,
the one bigger_than(60) returned. When calling this function using the argument
70, it returns True.

Note that

def f(x):
    return 2*x

is really just creating a name f and binding it to a new function object. So

    def test(x) :
        return x > v

binds the new function object to the local name test. And

    return test

returns the new function object currently bound to test (which remembers what
value v has in the Enclosing scope, even after test is returned and bigger_than
finishes executing).

Note the difference between the following, which both print 6.

x = f(3)
print(x)

and 

g = f
print(g(3))

A large part of this course deals with understanding functions better, including
but not restricted to function calls.

	<a name="funcMeth"><h1>Functions vs Methods</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Functions are typically called f(...) while methods are called on objects like
o.m(...). Think of x ='candide' followed by calling print(x.replace('d','p'))

In reality, a method call is just a special syntax to write a function
call. The special "argument" o (normally arguments are written inside the
parentheses) prefixes the method name. Functions and methods are related by
what I call "The Fundamental Equation of Object-Oriented Programming."

  o.m(...)     =     type(o).m(o,...)

On the right side
  1) type(o) returns a reference to the class object o was constructed from.
  2) .m means call the function m declared in that class: look for
       def m(self,...): .... in the class
  3) pass o as the first argument to m: recall, that when defining methods in
       classes we write def m(self, ....); where does the argument matching the
       self parameter come from? It comes from the object o in calls like
       o.m(...)

So, calling 'candide'.replace('d','p') is exactly the same as calling
str.replace('candide','d','p'), because type('candide') returns a reference to
the str class, which defines many methods, including replace.

How well do you understand self (or your-self, for that matter)? This equation
is the key. I believe a deep understanding of this equation is the key to
clarifying many aspects of object-oriented programming in Python (whose objects
are constructed from classes). Just my two cents. But we will often return to
this equation throughout this class. I've never seen any books that talk about
this equation explicitly.

Oh, by the way, I must say that this equation is true, but not completely true.
As we will later see: (a) if m is in the object's namespaces, it will be called
directly (bypassing looking in o's class/type), and (b) when we learn about
class inheritance, the inheritance hierarcy of a class provides other classes in
which to look for m if it is not declared directly in o's class/type.

But this equation is so simple and clear (once you understand it) and useful
for tons of examples, it is worth memorizing, even if it is not completely
accurate.

	<a name="lambda"><h1>Lambda:</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Lambdas are used in expressions where we need a very simple function. Instead
of defining a full function (with a def), we can just use a lambda: after the
word lambda comes its parameters separated by commas, then a colon followed by
a single EXPRESSION that computes the value of a lambda (no return needed, and
the function cannot include control structures/statments, not even a sequence
of statements).

So, writing ...(lambda x,y : x+y)... in some context

Is just like first defining

def f(x,y):
    return x+y

and then writing ...f... in the same context

A lambda is an unnamed function object. For example, we can also write the
following code, whose first line binds to the name f the lambda/function
object, and whose second line calls the lambda via the name.

f = lambda x,y : x+y  # lambdas have one expression after : without a return
print( f(1,3) )

and Python will print 4. I often put lambdas in parentheses, to more clearly
denote the start and end of the lambda, for example writing

f =  (lambda x,y : x+y)

Using this form, we can write code code above without defining f, writing just

print( (lambda x,y : x+y)(1,3) )

In my prompt module (MY PREFERRED WAY OF DOING PYTHON USER-INPUT), there is a
function called for_int that has a parameter that specifies a boolean function
(a function returning a boolean value: often called a predicate) that the
int value must satisfy, to be returned by the prompt (otherwise the for_int
function prompts the user again, for a legal value).

That is, we pass a function object to prompt.for_int, which calls that function
on the value the user enters to the prompt, to verify that the function returns
True for that value.

So the following code fragment is guaranteed to store a value between 0 to 5
inclusive in the variable x. If the user enters a value like 7, an error will
be printed and the user reprompted for the information.

import prompt
x = prompt.for_int('Enter a value in [0,5]', is_legal = (lambda x : 0<=x<=5))
print(x)

Execute this code in Python.

In a later part of this lecture note, we will see how to use lambdas to
simplify sorting lists (or simplify iterating through any data structures
according to an ordering function).

Again, I often put lambdas in parentheses for clarity: see the prompt.for_int
example above. But there are certain places where lambdas are required to be in
parentheses: calling g(1,(lambda x : x),3) requires the lambda to be in
parenthese, because without the parentheses it would read as g(1,lambda x : x,3)
In this function call, Python would not think that 3 was a third argument to
function g: it would instead interpret the body of the lambda a x,3 meaning
return a 2-tuple with x followed by 3.

In a previous section (functions returning functions) we wrote the code

def bigger_than(v) :
    def test(x) :
        return x > v
    return test

Because the test function is so simple, we can simplify this code by returning a
lambda instead of defining/returning a named function:

def bigger_than(v) :
    return (lambda x : x > v)

In each version of the bigger_than function, it returns a reference to a
function object.

	<a name="unpacking"><h1>Parallel/Tuple/List Assignment (aka sequence unpacking)</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Note that we can write code like the following: here both x,y and 1,2 are
implicit tuples, and we can unpack them as follows

x,y = 1,2

In fact, you can replace the left hand side of the equal sign by either (x,y) or
[x,y] and replace the right hand side of the equal sign by either (1,2) or [1,2]
and x gets assigned 1 and y get assigned 2: even (x,y) = [1,2] works correctly.

In most programming languages, to exchange the values of two variables x and y
we write three assignments (can you prove that writing just x = y followed by
y = x fails to exchange these values?):

temp = x
x    = y
y    = temp

In Python we can write this code using one tuple assignment

x,y = y,x

To do this parallel assignment Python
  (a) computes all the objects on the right (1 and 2 from the top)
  (b) binds the names on the left (x and y) to these objects (x to 2, y to 1)

This is also called "sequence unpacking assignment". Note that x,y = 1,2,3 and
x,y,z = 1,2 would both raise ValueError exceptions, because there are different
numbers of names and values to assign to them. We will frequently use simple
forms of parallel/unpacking assignment when looping through items in
dictionaries (illustated below), but even more complicated forms are possible:
for example.

l,m,(n,o) = (1, 2, [3,4])
print(l,m,n,o)

prints: 1 2 3 4

Generally sequence unpacking assignment is useful if we have a complex
tuple/list structure and we want to bind names to its components, to refer to
these components more easily: each name binds to part of the complicated
structure.

As another example, if we define a function that returns a tuple

def reverse(a,b) :
    return (b,a)    # we could also write just return b,a

we can also write x,y = reverse(x,y) to also exchange these values.

Finally, we can use unpacking assignment in for loops: for example, we can
write the following for loop to print the sum of each triple in the list

for i,j,k in [(1,2,3), (4,5,6), (7,8,9)]:
    print (i+j+k)

this is much simpler and clearer than usint one name for the entire tuple

for t in [(1,2,3), (4,5,6), (7,8,9)]:
    print (t[0] + t[1] + t[2])

The loop above assigns i, j, and k the three values in each 3-tuple in the list
that the for loop is iterating over. We will see more about such assignments
when  iterating though items in dictionaries. A preview is

for k,v in d.items():  #d is any dictionary
    print(k,'->',v)    #  print its key and value pairs (abbreviated k,v)

which prints each key and its associated value for each item (each key/value
association) that we are iterating through in a dictionary.

	<a name="sort"><h1>sort(a list method)/sorted (a function) and their key and reverse parameters</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
First, we will examine the following similar definitions of sort/sorted. Then we
will learn the differences between these features below.

(1) sort is a method defined on arguments that are LIST objects; it returns
      None but MUTATES its list argument to be in some specified order:
      e.g., alist.sort(...)

(2) sorted is a function defined on arguments that are any ITERABLE object; it
      returns a LIST of its  argument's values, in some specified order. The
      argument itself is NOT MUTATED: e.g., sorted(adict,...)

So, the sort method can be applied only to lists, and the sorted function can
be applied to any iterable (str, lists, tuples, sets, dict, etc.).

For example, if votes is the list of 2-tuples (candidates, votes) below, we can
execute the following code.

votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker', 20), ('Dog', 15)]
votes.sort()
for c,v in votes:                         # parallel/unpacking assignment
    print('Candidate',c,'received',v,'votes')
print(votes)

The call votes.sort() uses the sort METHOD to sort the LIST (MUTATE it); then
the for loop iterates over this newly-ordered list and prints the information
in the list in the order it now appears. When the entire votes list is printed
after the loop, we see the list has been MUTATED and is now sorted.

Contrast this with the following code.

votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker' ,20), ('Dog', 15)]
for c,v in sorted(votes):                 # parallel/unpacking assignment
    print('Candidate',c,'received',v,'votes')
print(votes)

Here we never sort/mutate the votes list. Instead we use the sorted FUNCTION to 
produce a NEW LIST that is sorted, and then iterate over that list to print
the information in the votes list in sorted form. But when we print the votes
list at the end, we see the list remained unchanged The sorted function makes a
copy of its argument list, produces a new list with these values sorted, and
then returns that new list (which the for loop iterates over): sorted does not
mutate the original list it operates on.

Question: What would the following code do? If you understand the definitions
above, you won't be fooled and the answer won't suprise you. Hint: what does
votes.sort() return?

votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker' ,20), ('Dog', 15)]
for c,v in votes.sort():
    print('Candidate',c,'received',v,'votes')
print(votes)

If we were going to print some list in a sorted form many times, it would be
more efficient to sort/mutate it once, and then use a regular for loop on that
sorted list (either mutate the original or create a new, sorted list). But if
we needed to keep the list in a certain order care about space efficiency
and/or don't care as much about time efficienty, we would not sort/mutate the
list and instead call the sorted function whenever we need to procss the list
in a sorted order.

Note that if we change votes to be dict data structure, and then tried to call
the sort method, Python would raise an exception

votes_dict = {'Charlie': 20, 'Able': 10, 'Baker': 20, 'Dog': 15}
votes_dict.sort()

It would show as
  AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'sort'
The problem is: the sort method is defined only on list class object, not dicts.

So, Python cannot execute votes_dict.sort()! It makes no sense to sort a
dictionary. In fact, we cannot sort strings (they are immutable); we cannot
sort tuples (they are immutable); we cannot sort sets (they have no order,
which actually allows them to operate more efficiently; we'll learn why later
in the quarter); we cannot sort dicts (like sets, they have no order, which
allows them to operate more efficiently; ditto).

But, we can call the sorted function on all four of these data structures, and
on any kind of iterable: Python executes sorted by creating a temporary list
from all the values produced by the iterable, then sorts that list, and then
returns it. Here is one example of how the sorted function processes votes as a
dict. Note that executing sorted(votes_dict) is the same as executing
sorted(votes_dict.keys()) which produces and iterates over a sorted list of the
dict's keys.

votes_dict = {'Charlie' : 20, 'Able' :  10, 'Baker' : 20, 'Dog' : 15}
for c in sorted(votes_dict):       # same as: for c in sorted(votes_dict.keys())
    print('Candidate',c,'received',votes_dict[c],'votes')
print(votes_dict)

---Start example
Note: if we wrote

votes_dict = {'Charlie' : 20, 'Able' :  10, 'Baker' : 20, 'Dog' : 15}
print(sorted(votes_dict))

Python prints a list of the dictionary's keys in sorted order:

['Able', 'Baker', 'Charlie', 'Dog']
---Stop example

Well, this is one "normal" way to iterate over a sorted list built from a
dictionary. We can also iterate over sorted "items" in a dictionary as follows
(the difference is in the for loop and the print). We will examine more about
dicts and the different ways to iterate over them later in this lecture. Recall
that each item in a dictionary is a 2-tuple consisting of one key and its
associated value.

votes_dict = {'Charlie' : 20, 'Able' :  10, 'Baker' : 20, 'Dog' : 15}
for c,v in sorted(votes_dict.items()):
    print('Candidate',c,'received',v,'votes')
print(votes_dict)

---Start example
Note: if we wrote

votes_dict = {'Charlie' : 20, 'Able' :  10, 'Baker' : 20, 'Dog' : 15}
print(list(votes_dict.items()))
print(sorted(votes_dict.items()))

Python first prints a list of the dictionary's items in an unspecified order,
then it prints a list of the smae dictionary's items, in sorted order:

[('Able', 10), ('Dog', 15), ('Charlie', 20), ('Baker', 20)]
[('Able', 10), ('Baker', 20), ('Charlie', 20), ('Dog', 15)]
---Stop example

Notice that this print doesn't access votes[c] to get the votes, that is the
second item in each 2-tuple being iterated over using .items(). This is because
votes_dict.items() produces a sequence of 2-tuples, each containing one key and
its associated value. The order that these 2-tuples appear in the list is
unspecified, but using the sorted function ensures that the keys are examined in
order.

How does sort/sorted work? How do they know how to compare the values they are
sorting? There is a standard way to compare any data structures, but we can also
use the "key" and "reverse" parameters (which must be used with their names, not
positionally) to tell Python how to do the sorting. The reverse parameter is
simpler, so let's look at it first; writing sorted(votes,reverse=True) sorts,
but in the reverse order (reverse=False is like not specifying reverse at all).
So, returning to votes as a list,

votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker' ,20), ('Dog', 15)]
print(sorted(votes,reverse=True))

prints

[('Dog', 15), ('Charlie', 20), ('Baker', 20), ('Able', 10)]

What sort is doing is comparing each value in the list to the others using the
standard meaning of <. You should know how Python compares str values, but how
does Python compare whether one tuple is less than another? Or whether one list
is less than another? The algorithm in analagous to strings, so let's first
re-examine comparing strings. The ordering, by the way, is called lexicographic
ordering, and also dictionary ordering (related to the order words appear in
dictionaries, but unrelated to Python dicts).

---------------
Interlude: Comparing Strings in Python:

String comparison: x to y (high level):

Find the first/minimum index i such that the ith character in x and y are
different (or, x[i] != y[i]). If that character in x is less than that
character in y (by the standard ASCII table) then x is less than y; if that
character in x is greater than that character in y then x is greater than y;
if there is no such different character, then x compares to y as x's length
compares to y's (either less than, equal or greater than).

Here are three examples:

  (1) How do we compare x = 'aunt' and y = 'anteater'? The first/minimum i such
  that the characters are different is 1: x[1] is 'u' and y[1] is 'n'; 'u' is
  greater than 'n' so x > y.

  (2) How do we compare x = 'ant' and y = 'anteater'? There is no first/minimum
  i such that the characters are different; len(x) < len(y) so x < y. The word
  'ant' appears in an English dictionary before the word 'anteater'.

  (3) How do we compare x = 'ant' and y = 'ant'? There is no first/minimum i
  such that the characters are different; len(x) == len(y) so x == y. I show
  this example, which is trivial, just to be complete.

See the Handouts(General) webpage showing the ASCII character set, because
there are some suprises. You should memorize that the digits and lower/upper
case letters compare in order, and all digts < all upper-case letters < all
lower-case letters. So 'HUGE' < 'tiny' is True because 'H' is < 't' (all
upper-case letters have smaller ASCII values than any upper-lower case letters).
Likewise, 'Aunt' < 'aunt' because 'A' < 'a'. Note that we can always use the
upper() method (as in x.upper() < y.upper()) or lower() method to perform a
comparison that ignores case.
---------------

Back to comparing tuples (or lists). We basically do the same thing. We look at
what is in index 0 in the tuples; if different, then the tuples compare in the
same way as the values in index 0 compare; if the values at this index are the
same, we keep going until we find a difference, and compare the tuples the same
way that the differences compare; if there are no differences the tuples
compare the same way their lengths compare.

So ('UCI', 100) < ('UCSD', 50) is True because at index 0, the string values are
different and 'UCI' is < 'UCSD' because index 2 in these strings are different,
and 'I' < 'S'. Whereas ('UCI', 100) < ('UCI', 200) is True because the values
at index 0 are the same ('UCI' == 'UCI'), so we go to index 1, where we find
different values, and 100 < 200. Finally, ('UCI', 100) < ('UCI', 100, 'extra')
is True because the values at index 0 are the same ('UCI' == 'UCI') and the
values at index 1 are the same (100 == 100), and the last tuple has a larger
length.

Recall the sorting code from above.

votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker' ,20), ('Dog', 15)]
for c,v in sorted(votes):
    print('Candidate',c,'received',v,'votes')
print(votes)

The reason that the values come out in the order they do in the code above is
because the names that are in the first index in each 2-tuple ensure the tuples
are sorted alphabetically. Python never gets to looking at the second value in
each tuple, because the first values (the candidate names) are always different.

Now, what if we don't want to sort by the natural tuple ordering. We can
specify a "key" function that computes a key value for every value in what is
being sorted, and the computed key values are used for comparison, not the
original values themselves. These are the "keys" for comparison.

See the by_vote_count function below; it takes a 2-tuple argument and returns
only the second value in the tuple (recall indexes start at 0) for the key on
which Python will compare. For the argument tuple ('Baker' ,20) by_vote_count
returns 20.

def by_vote_count(t):
    return t[1]            # remember t[0] is the first index.

So, when we sort with key=by_vote_count, we are telling the sorted function to
determine the order of values by calling the by_vote_count function on each
value: so in this call of sorted, we are comparing tuples based solely on their
vote part. So writing

votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker' ,20), ('Dog', 15)]
for c,v in sorted(votes, key=by_vote_count):
    print('Candidate',c,'received',v,'votes')

produces 

Candidate Able received 10 votes
Candidate Dog received 15 votes
Candidate Charlie received 20 votes
Candidate Baker received 20 votes

First, notice in "key=by_vote_count" Python didn't CALL the by_vote_count
function (there are no parentheses) it just passed its associated function
object to the key parameter in sorted. Inside the sorted function,
by_vote_count's function object automatically is called where needed, to
compare two 2-tuples, to determine in which order these values will appear in
the returned list.

Also, because Charlie and Baker both received the same number of votes, they
both appear at the bottom, in an unspeficied order.

Notice that the tuples are printed in ascending votes; generally for elections
we want the votes to be descending, so we can combine using key and reverse
(with reverse=True) in the call to the sorted function.

votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker' ,20), ('Dog', 15)]
for c,v in sorted(votes, key=by_vote_count, reverse=True):
    print('Candidate',c,'received',v,'votes')

which produces 

Candidate Charlie received 20 votes
Candidate Baker received 20 votes
Candidate Dog received 15 votes
Candidate Able received 10 votes

Again, since the top two candidates both received the same number of votes, they
appear in an unspecified order.

Now, rather than define this simple by_vote_count function, we can use a lambda
instead, and write the following.

...
for c,v in sorted(votes, key=(lambda t : t[1]), reverse=True):
    ...

So, now we don't have to write/name that extra by_vote_count function. Of
course, if we did write it, we could reuse it wherever we wanted, instead of
rewriting the lambda (but the lambdas are pretty small). So, we now know how to
use functions and lambdas in sorted: and, they are used the same way in sort.

Another way to sort in reverse order (for integers) is to use the "negate" trick
illustrated below.

...
for c,v in sorted(votes, key=(lambda t : -t[1]) ):
    ...

Here we have negated the vote count part of the tuple, and removed reverse=True.
So it is sorting from smallest to largest, but by the negative of the vote
values (because that is what key says to do). It is using -20, -10, -20, and -15
to sort. So the biggest vote count corresponds to the smallest negative number
(so that tuple will appear first). The tuples appear in the order specified by
the key functions: -20, -20, -15, -10 (smallest to largest).

Finally, typically when multiple candidates are tied for votes, we print their
names close together (because they all have the same number of votes) but also
in alphabetical order. We do this in Python by specifying a key function that
returns a tuple in which the vote count is checked first and sorted in
descending order; and only if they are tied will the names be checked and
sorted in ascending order. Because we want the tuples in decreasing vote
counts but increasing names, we cannot use reverse=True: it would reverse both
the vote AND name comparisons; we need to resort to the "negation" trick above
and write

votes = [('Charlie', 20), ('Able', 10), ('Baker' ,20), ('Dog', 15)]
for c,v in sorted(votes, key=lambda t : (-t[1],t[0]) ):
    print('Candidate',c,'received',v,'votes')

So it compares the key 2-tuples (-20, 'Charlie'), (-10, 'Able'), (-20, 'Baker'),
and (-15, 'Dog') when ordering the actual 2-tuples, and by what we have learned

(-20, 'Baker') < (-20, 'Charlie') < (-15, 'Dog') < (-10, 'Able')

which produces 

Candidate Baker received 20 votes
Candidate Charlie received 20 votes
Candidate Dog received 15 votes
Candidate Able received 10 votes

Note that the lambda in the key ensures Python compares ('Charlie', 20) and
('Dog', 15) as if they were (-20, 'Charlie') and (-15, 'Dog') so the first
tuple will be less and appear earlier (the one with the highest votes has the
lowest negative votes). And when Python compares ('Charlie', 20) and
('Baker' ,20) as if they were (-20, 'Charlie') and (-20, 'Baker') so the second
tuple will be less and appear earlier (equal votes and 'Baker' < 'Charlie').

So think of sorting

('Charlie', 20)   ('Able', 10)   ('Baker' ,20)   ('Dog', 15)
       |                |               |              |
       |                |               |              |  using the key function
       V                V               V              V
(-20, 'Charlie')  (-10, 'Able')  (-20, 'Baker')  (-15, 'Dog')

which sorts to 

(-20,'Baker')  (-20,'Charlie')  (-15,'Dog')  (-10,'Able')

so the order of the actual list returned by sorted is

[('Baker', 20), ('Charlie', 20), ('Dog', 15),  ('Able', 10)]

which is sorted by decreasing vote, with equal votes sorted alphabetically
increasing by name.

You now have a good tool bag for sorting various types of information.

	<a name="print"><h1>The print function</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Notice how the sep and end parameters in print help control how the printed
values are separated and what is printed after the last one. Recall that print
can have any number of arguments (we will see how this is done in Python soon),
and it prints the str(...) of each parameter. By default, sep=' ' (space) and
end='\n' (newline). So the following

print(1,2,3,4,sep='--',end='/')
print(5,6,7,8,sep='x',end='**')

prints

1--2--3--4/5x6x7x8**

Also recall that all functions must return a value. The print function returns
the value None: this function serves as a statement: it has an "effect" (of
displaying information in the console window; we might say changing the state
of the console) but returns no useful "value", just None.

Sometimes we use sep='' to control spaces more finely. In this case we must put
in all the spaces ourselves.

print(1,2,' ',3,sep='')

prints

12 3

Still, other times we can concatenate values together into one string (which
requires us to explicitly use the str function on the things we want to print).

x = 10
print('Your answer of '+str(x)+' is too high.'+'\nThis is on the next line')

Note the use of the "escape" sequence \n to generate a new line.

Finally, we can also use the very general-purpose .format function. This
function is illustrated in Section 6.1.3 in the documentation of The Python
Standard Library. The following two statements print equivalently: for a string
with many format substitutions, I prefer the form with a name (here x) in the
braces of the string and as a named parameter in the arguments to format.

print('Your answer of {} is too high\nThis is on the next line'.format(10))

print('Your answer of {x} is too high\nThis is on the next line'.format(x=10))

	<a name="slicing"><h1>String/List/Tuple (SLT) slicing:</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
SLTs represent sequences of indexable values, whose indexes start index 0, and
go up to -but do not include- the length of the SLT (which we can compute using
the len function).

1) Indexing: We can index an SLT by writing SLT[i], where i is positive and in
   the range 0 to len(SLT)-1 inclusive, or i is negative and i is in the range
  -len(SLT) to -1 inclusive: SLT[0] is the first index, SLT[-1] is the last.

2) Slicing: We can specify a slice by SLT[i:j] which includes SLT[i] followed
   by SLT[i+1], ... SLT[j-1]. Slicing a string produces another string,
   slicing a list produces another list, and slicing a tuple produces another
   tuple. The resulting structures has j-i elements if indexes i through j are
   in the SLT (or 0 if j-i is <= 0); this formula works for positive and
   negative index values. If the first index is any character before index 0,
   then index 0 is used; if the last index is any character beyond the last
   index, then index lend(SLT) is used;

s = 'abcde'
x = s[1:3]
print (x)     # prints 'bc' which is 3-1 = 2 values
x = s[-4:-1]
print (x)     # prints 'bcd' which is -1-(-4) = 3 values
x = s[1:10]
print (x)     # prints 'bcde' which is len(x)-1 = 4 values

   likewise

s = ('a','b','c','d','e')
x = s[1:3]
print (x)     # prints ('b','c') which is 3-1 = 2 values
x = s[-4:-1]
print (x)     # prints ('b','c','d') which is -1-(-4) = 3 values

   s[:i] is index 0 up to but not including i (can be positive or negative)
   s[i:] is index i up to and including the last index; so s[-2:] is the last
         two values.

3) Slicing with a stride: We can specify a slice by SLT[i:j:k] which includes
   SLT[i] followed by SLT[i+k], SLT[i+2k] ... SLT[j-1]. This follows the rules
   for slicing too, and allows negative numbers for indexing.

s = ('a','b','c','d','e')
x = s[::2]
print (x)     # prints ('a','c','e')
x = s[1::2]
print (x)     # prints ('b','d'')

x = s[3:1:-1]
print (x)     # prints ('d','c')
x = s[-1:1:-1]
print (x)     # prints ('e','d','c')

Experiment with various slices of strings (the easiest to write) to verify you
understand what result they produce.

	<a name="condition"><h1>Conditional statement vs. Conditional expression</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Python has an if/else STATEMENT, which is a conditional statement. It also has a
conditional EXPRESSION that uses the same keywords (if and else), which while
not as generally useful, sometimes is exactly the right tool to simplify a task.
A conditional statement uses a boolean expression to decide which block to
execute; a conditional expression uses a boolean expression to decide which
other expression to evaluate: the value of that expression is the value of the
conditional expression.

The form of a conditional expression is

  resultT if test else resultF

This says, the expression evaluates to the value of resultT if test is True
and the value of resultF if test is False; first it evaluates test, and then
evaluates either resultT or resultF (but only one, not the other) as necessary.
Like other short-circuit operators in Python (do you know which?) it evaluates
only the subexpressions it needs to evaluate to determine the result.

I often put conditional expresions inside parentheses for clarity (as I did for
lambdas). See the examples below.

Here is a simple example. We start with a conditional statement, which always
stores a value into min: either x or y depending on whether x <= y. Note that
regardless of the test, min is bound to a value.

  if x <= y:
      min = x
  else:
      min = y

We can write this using a simpler conditional expression, capturing the fact
that we are always storing into min, and just deciding which value to store.

  min = (x if x <= y else y)

Not all conditional statements can be converted into conditional expressions;
typically only simple ones can: ones with a single statement in their blocks.
But using conditional expressions in these cases simplifies the code even more.
So attempt to use conditional expression, but use good judgement after you see
what the code looks like.

Here is another example; it always prints x followed by some message

  if x % 2 == 0:
      print(x,'is even')
  else:
      print(x,'is odd')

We can rewrite it as as calling print with a conditional expression inside
deciding what string to print at the end.

      print(x, ('is even' if x%2 == 0 else 'is odd'))

We can also write it as a one argument print:

      print(str(x) + ' is ' +('even' if x%2 == 0 else 'odd'))

Note that conditional expressions require using both the if and else keywords,
along with the two expressions needed in the cases where the test is True or
the test is False. Some conditional statements just use if (and no else)

	<a name="else"><h1>The else: block-else option in for/while loops</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
For and while looping statements are described as follows. The else: block-else
is optional, and not often used. But we will explore its meaning here.

for_statement   <= for index(es) in iterable:
                       block-body
                   [else:
                       block-else]

while_statement <= while <bool-expression>:
                       block-body
                   [else:
                       block-else]

Here are the semantics of else: block-else.

   If the else: block-else option appears, and the loop terminated normally,
   (not with a break statement) then execute block-else.

Here is an example that makes good use of the else: block-else option. This
code prints the first/lowest value (looking at the values 0 to 100 inclusive)
for which the function special_property returns True (and then breaks out of
the loop); otherwise it prints that no value in this range had this property:
so it prints exactly one of these two messages. Note you cannot run this code,
because there is no special_property function: I'm using it for illustration
only.

for i in irange(100):
    if special_property(i):
        print(i,'is the first value with the special property')
        break
else:
    print('No value in the range had the special property')

Without the else: block-else option, the simplest code that I can write that has
equivalent meaning is as follows.

found_one = False
for i in irange(100):
    if special_property(i):
        print(i,'is the first with the special property')
        found_one = True
        break
if not found_one:
    print('No value in the range had the special property')

This solution requires an extra name (found_one), an assignment to set and
reset the name, and an if statement. Although I came up with the example above,
I have not used the else: block-else option much in Python. Most programming
languages that I have used don't have this special feature, so I'm still
exploring its usefulness. Every so often I have found an elegant use of this
construct. 

Can you predict what would happen if I removed the break statement in the
bigger code above?

	<a name="matching"><h1>Argument/Parameter Matching (leaves out **kargs, discussed later)</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Let's explore the argument/parameter matching rules. First we classify
arguments and parameters, according the options they include. Remember that
arguments appear in function calls and parameter appear in function headers.

Arguments
  positional argument: an argument NOT preceded by the name= option
  named      argument: an argument preceded by the name= option

Parameters
  name-only parameter       : a parameter with NO default value
  default-argument parameter: a parameter including a default argument value

When Python calls a function, it defines every parameter name in the
function's header, and binds to each (just like an assignment statement) the
argument value object matching that parameter's name. In the rules below, we
will learn exactly how Python matches arguments to parameters according to three
criteria: positions, parameter names, and default arguments for parameter
names. We will also learn how to write functions that can receive an arbitrary
number of arguments.

Here is a concise statement of Python's rules for matching arguments to
parameters. The rules are applied in this order (e.g., once you reach M3 we
cannot go back to M1).

M1. Match positional argument values in the call sequentially to the
    parameters named in the header's corresponding positions (both name-only
    and default-argument parameters are OK to match). Stop when reaching any
    named argument in the call, or the * parameter (if any) in the header.

M2. If matching a * parameter in the header, match all remaining positional
    argument values to it. Python creates a tuple that stores all these
    arguments. The parameter name (typically args) is bound to this tuple.

M3. Match named-argument values in the call to their like-named parameters
    in the header (both name-only and default-argument parameters are OK)

M4. Match any remaining default-argument parameters in the header, un-
    matched by rules M1 and M3, with their specified default arguments.

M5. Exceptions: If at any time (a) an argument cannot match a parameter
    (e.g., a positional-argument follows a named-argument) or (b) a parameter
    is matched multiple times by arguments; or if at the end of the process
    (c) any parameter has not been matched or (d) if a named-argument does not
    match the name of a parameter, raise an exception: SyntaxError for (a) and
    TypeError for (b), (c), and (d). These exceptions report that the function
    call does not correctly match its header.

(When we examine a **kargs as a parameter, we will learn what Python does when
there are extra named arguments in a function call: names besides those of
parameters: preview: it puts all remaing named arguments in a dictionary, with
their name as the key and their value associated with that key). The parameter
name (typically kargs) is bound to this dictionary.

When this argument-parameter matching process if finished, Python defines,
(in the function's namespace), a name for every parameter and binds each to
the unique argument it matches using the above rules. Passing parameters is
similar to performing a series of assignment statements between parameter names
and their argument values.

If a function call raises no exception, these rules ensure that each parameter
in the function header matches the value of exactly one argument in the
function call. After Python binds each parameter name to its argument, it
executes the body of the function, which computes and returns the result of
calling the function

Here are some examples of functions that we can call to explore the rules for
argument/parameter matching specified above. These functions just print their
parameters, so we can see the arguments bound to them (or see which exception
they raise).

def f(a,b,c=10,d=None): print(a,b,c,d)
def g(a=10,b=20,c=30) : print(a,b,c)
def h(a,*b,c=10)      : print(a,b,c)

Call              | Parameter/Argument Binding (matching rule)
------------------+--------------------------------------------
f(1,2,3,4)	  | a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4(M1)
f(1,2,3)	  | a=1, b=2, c=3(M1); d=None(M4)

h(1,2,3,4,5)	  | a=1(M1); b=(2,3,4,5)(M2), c=10(M4)
h(1,2,3,4,c=5)    | a=1(M1); b=(2,3,4)(M2), c=5(M3)
h(a=1,2,3,4,c=5)  | a=1(M3); SyntaxError(M5a:2)
h(1,2,3,4,c=5,a=1)| a=1(M1); b=(2,3,4)(M2); c=5(M3); TypeError(M5b:a matched twice)

Here is a real but simple example of using *args, showing how the max function
is implememented in Python; we dont' really need to write this function because
it is in Python already, but here it is written in Python. We will cover raising
exceptions later in this lecture note, so don't worry about that code .

def max(*args) :     	   # Can refer to args inside; it is a tuple of values
    if len(args) == 0:
        raise TypeError('max: expected >=1 arguments, got 0')
    answer = args[0]
    for i in args[1:]:
        if i > answer:
            answer = i
    return answer
print(max(3,-4, 2, 8))

Here is another real example of using *args, where I show how the print function
is written in Python. The myprint calls a very simple version of print, just
once at the end, to print the string that it builds from args along with sep
and end; it prints the same thing the normal print would print with the same
arguments. Notice the use of the conditional if in the first line, to
initialize s to either '' or the string value of the first argument.

def myprint(*args, sep=' ', end='\n'):
    s = (str(args[0]) if len(args) >= 1 else '') # handle 1st (if there) special
    for a in args[1:]:	 	      	     	 # all others with sep
        s += sep + str(a)
    s += end					 # end at the end
    print(s,end='')				 # print the entire string s

myprint('a',1,'x')			# prints a line
myprint('a',1,'x',sep='*',end='E')	# prints a line but stays at end
myprint('a',1,'x')			# continues at end of previous line

These print.

a 1 x
a*1*xEa 1 x

	<a name="constructors"><h1>Constructors operating on Iterable values to Construct Data</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
List, Tuples, Sets:

Python's "for" loops allow us to iterate through all the components of any
iterable data. We can even iterate through strings: iterating over their
individual characters. Later in the quarter, we will study iterator protocols
in detail, both the special iter/__iter__ and next/__next__ methods in classes,
and generators (which are very very similar to functions, with a small but
powerful twist). Both will improve our understanding of iterators and also
allow us to write our own iterable data types (classes). 

Certainly we know about using "for" loops and iterable data (as illustrated by
lots of code above). What I want to illustrate here is how easy it is to
create lists, tuples, and sets from anything that is iterable by using the
list, tuple, and set constructors (we'll deal with dict constructors later in
this section). For example, in each of the following the constructor for the
list/tuple/set objects iterates over the string argument to get the 1-char
strings that become the values in the list/tuple/set object.

l = list ('radar') then l is ['r', 'a', 'd', 'a', 'r']
t = tuple('radar') then t is ('r', 'a', 'd', 'a', 'r')
s = set  ('radar') then s is {'a', 'r', 'd'} or {'d', 'r', 'a'} or ...

Note that lists/tuples are ORDERED, so whatever the iteration order of their
iterator argument is, the values in the list/tuple will be the same order.
Contrast this with sets, which have (no duplicates and) no special order. So,
set('abcde') can print its three different values in any order.

Likewise, since tuples/sets are iterable, we can also compute a list from a
list, a list from a a tuple, or a list from a set. Using l, t, and s from above.

list(t) which is ['r', 'a', 'd', 'a', 'r']
list(s) which is ['r', 'a', 'd']  assuming s iterates in the order 'r', 'a', 'd'
list(l) which is ['r', 'a', 'd', 'a', 'r']

The last of these iterates over the list to create a new list with the same
values: note that l is list(l) is False, but l == list(l) is True.

Likewise we could create a tuple from a list/set, or a set from a list/tuple.
All the constructors handle iterable data, producing a result of the specified
type by iterating over their argument.

Note that students sometime try to use a list constructor create a list with one
value. They write list(1), by Python responds with "TypeError: 'int' object is
not iterable" because the list constructor is expecting an iterable argument.
The correct way to specify this list with one value is [1]. Likewise for tuples,
sets, and dictionaries.

Program #1 will give you lots of experience with these data types and when and
how to use them. The take-away now is it is trivial to convert from one of these
data types to another, because the constructors for their classes all allow
iterable values as their arguments, and all these data types (and strings as
well) are iterable (can be iterated over).


Dictionary Constructors:

Before leaving this topic, we need to look at how dictionaries fit into the 
notion of iterable. There is not ONE way to iterate through dictionaries, but
there are actually THREE ways to iterate through dictionaries: by keys, by
values, and by items (each item a 2-tuple with a key folowed by its associated
value).  Each of these is summoned by a method name for dict, and the methods
are named the same: keys, values, and items.

So if we write the following to bind d to a dict (we will discuss this "magic"
constructor soon)

d = dict(a=1,b=2,c=3,d=4,e=5) # the same as d = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3,'d':4,'e':5}

Then we can create lists of three aspects of the dict:

list(d.keys  ()) is like ['c', 'b', 'a', 'e', 'd']
list(d.values()) is like [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]
list(d.items ()) is like [('c', 3), ('b', 2), ('a', 1), ('e', 5), ('d', 4)]

Note that like sets, dicts are NOT ORDERED: in the first case we get a list
of the keys; in the second a list of the values; in the third a list of itme
tuples, where each tuple contains one key and its associate value. But in all
three cases, the values can appear in ANY ORDER.

Note that the keys in a dict are always unique, but there might be duplicates
among the values: try the code above with d = dict(a=1,b=2,c=1). Items are
unique because they contain keys (which are unique).

Also note that if we iterate over a dict without specifying how, it is
equivalent to specifyihg d.keys(). That is

list(d) is the same as list(d.keys()) which is like ['a', 'c', 'b', 'e', 'd']

One way to construct a dict is to give it an iterable, where each value
is either a 2-tuple or 2-list: a key followed by its associated value. So, we
could have written any of the following to initialize d:

d = dict( [['a', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 3], ['d', 4], ['e', 5]] ) #list of  2-list
d = dict( [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('e', 5)] ) #list of  2-tuple
d = dict( (['a', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 3], ['d', 4], ['e', 5]) ) #tuple of 2-list
d = dict( (('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('e', 5)) ) #tuple of 2-tuple

or, even (a tuple that has a mixture of 2-tuples and 2-lists in it)

d = dict( (('a', 1), ['b', 2], ('c', 3), ['d', 4], ('e', 5)) )

or even (a set of 2-tuples; we cannot have a set of 2-list (see hashable below)

d = dict( {('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('e', 5)} )

The dict argument must be iterable, and each value in the iterable must have 2
values (e.g., a 2-list or 2-tuple) that represent a key followed by its
associated value.

Finally, if we wanted to construct a dict using the keys/values in another
dict, here are two easy ways to do it

d_copy = dict(d))

or

d_copy = dict(d.items())

	<a name="sharing"><h1>Sharing/Copying:  is vs. == (one more time)</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
It is important to understand the fundamental difference between two names
sharing an object (bound to the same object) and two names referring/bound to
"copies of the same object". Note that if we mutate a shared object, both names
"see" the change: both are bound to the same object which has mutated. But if
they refer to different copies of an object, only one name "sees" the change.

Note the difference between the Python operators is and ==. The first asks
whether two references/binding are to the same object (this operator is called
the object-identity operator); the second asks only whether the two objects
store the same values. See the different results produced for the example
below. Also note that if x is y is True, then x == y must be True too: an object
stores the same values as itself. But if x == y is True, x is y may or may not
be True.

For example, compare execution of the following scripts: the only difference
is the second statement in each: y = x vs. y = list(x)

x = ['a']
y = x		# Critical: y and x share the same reference
print('x:',x,'y:',y,'x is y:',x is y,'x == y:',x==y)
x [0] = 'z'	# Mutate x (could also append something to it)
print('x:',x,'y:',y,'x is y:',x is y,'x == y:',x==y)

This prints
x: ['a'] y: ['a'] x is y: True x == y: True
x: ['z'] y: ['z'] x is y: True x == y: True

x = ['a']
y = list(x)	# Critical: y refers to a new list with the same contents as x
print('x:',x,'y:',y,'x is y:',x is y,'x == y:',x==y)
x [0] = 'z'	# Mutate x (could also append something to it: x+)
print('x:',x,'y:',y,'x is y:',x is y,'x == y:',x==y)

This prints
x: ['a'] y: ['a'] x is y: False x == y: True
x: ['z'] y: ['a'] x is y: False x == y: False

Finally there is a copy module in Python that defines a copy function: it
copies some iterable without us having to specify the specific constructor
(like list, set, tuple, or dict).

So we can import it as: from copy import copy

Assuming x is a list, we can replace y = list(x) by y = copy(x).
Likewise, if x is a dict we can replace y = dict(x) by y = copy(x)

We could also just: import copy (the module) and then write y = copy.copy(x)
but it is clearer in this case to write "from copy import copy".

	<a name="hashable"><h1>Hashable vs. Mutable and how to Change Things:</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Python uses the term Hashable, which has the same meaning as Immutable. So
hashable and mutable are OPPOSITES: You might see this message relating to
errors when using sets with UNHASHABLE values or dicts with UNHASHABLE keys:
since hashable means immutable, then un-hashable means un-immutable which
simplifies (the two negatives cancel) to mutable. So unhashable is mutable. So

hashable    is immutable
unhashalble is mutable

Here is a quick breakdown of standard Python types

Hashable/immutable: strings, tuples, frozenset
mutable/unhashable: list, sets, dicts

The major difference between tuples and lists in Python is the former is
immutable and the later is not. So if some other datatype (e.g., values in
a set, or keys in a dictionary) needs to be hashable/immutable, use a tuple
to represent its values.

A frozenset can do everything that a set can do, but doesn't allow any mutator
methods to be called (so we cannot add a value to or delete a value from a
frozenset). Thus, we can use a frozen set as a value in a set or a key in a
dictionary.

The constructor for a frozenset is frozenset(...) not {}. Note that once you've
constructed a frozen set you cannot change it (because it is immutable). If you
have a set s and need an equivalent frozenset, just write frozenset(s).

We will study hashing towards the end of the quarter: it is a technique for
allowing very efficient operations on sets and dicts. ICS-46 (Data Structures)
studies hash tables in much more depth, in which you will implement the
equivalent of Python sets and dicts by using hash tables.

	<a name="comp"><h1>Comprehensions: list, tuple, set, dict</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
List, Tuple, Set Comprehensions:

Comprehensions are compact ways to generate complicated (but not too
complicated) lists, tuples, sets, and dicts. That is, they compactly solve some
problems but cannot solve all problems (for example, we cannot use them to
mutate values in an existing data structure). The general form of a list
comprehension is as follows, where f means any function (or expression: we can
also just write var because a name by itself is a simple expression having a
value) using var and p means any predicate (or bool expresssion) using var.

[f(var) for var in iterable if p(var)]

Meaning: collect together into a list (because of the outer []) all of f(var)
values, for var taking on every value in iterable, but only collect an f(var)
value if it corresponding p(var) is True.

For tuple or set comprehensions, we would use () and {} as the outermost
grouping symbol instead of [] (we'll talk about dicts at the end, which use
{} and : inside to get the job done and be distinguised from sets which use {}
without : inside).

Note that the "if p(var)" part is optional, so we can also write comprehensions
as follows (in which case it has the same meaning as p(var) always being True).

[f(var) for var in iterable]   meaning   [f(var) for var in iterable if True]

for example

x = [i**2 for i in irange(1,10) if i%2==0]	# note: irange not range
print(x)

prints the squares of all the integers from 1 to 10 inclusive, but only if the
integer is even (computed as leaving a remainder of 0 when divided by 2). Run 
it. Change it a bit to get is to do something else. Here is another example

x = [2*c for c in 'some text' if c in 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxy']
print(x)

which prints a list with strings that are doubled for all the consonants
(no aeiouy -or spaces for that matter): ['ss', 'mm', 'tt', 'xx', 'tt']

We can translate any list comprehension into equivalent code that uses more
familiar Python looping/if/list appending features.

x = []	       	  	   # start with an empty list
for var in iterable:	   # iterate through iterable
   if p(var):		   # if var is acceptable?
       x.append(f(var))	   # add f(var) next in the list

But often using a comprehension (in the right places: where you want to
generate some list, tuple, set or dict) is simpler. Not all lists that we
build can be written as simple comprehensions, but the ones that can are often
very simple to write, read, and understand when written as comprehensions.

What comprehensions aren't good for is putting information into a data structure
and then mutating/changing it during the execution of the comprehension; for
that job you need code more like the loop above. So when deciding whether or
not to use a comprehension, ask youself if you can specify each value in the
data structure without changing it (as was done above, using comprehensions).

Note that we can add-to (mutate) lists, sets, and dicts, but not tuples. For
tuples we would have to write this code with x = () at the top and
x = x + (var,) in the middle: which builds an entirely new tuple by
concatenating the old one and a one-tuple (containing only x) and then binding
x to the newly constructed tuple. Don't worry about these details, but
understand that unlike lists, tuples have no mutator methods (so x.append(...)
is not allowed)

Here is something interesting (using a set comprehension: notice {} around the
comprehension.

x = {c for c in "I've got plenty of nothing"}	# note ' in str delimited by "
print(sorted(x))

It prints a set of all the characters (in a list, in sorted order, created by
sorted(x)) in the string but because it is a set, each character occurs one
time. So even though a few c's have the same value, only one of each appears in
the set because of the semantics/meaning of sets. Note it prints

[' ', "'", 'I', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'l', 'n', 'o', 'p', 't', 'v', 'y']

If we used a list comprehension, it would be much longer because, for example,
the character 't' would occur 3 times in a list (but occurs only once in a set)


Dict Comprehensions:

The form for dict comprehensions is similar, here k and v are functions (or
expressions) using var. Notice the {} on the outside and the : on the inside,
separating the key from the value: that is how Python knows the comprehension
is a dict not a set.

{k(var) : v(var) for var in iterable if p(var)}

So,

x = {k : len(k) for k in ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five']}
print(x)

prints a dictionary that stores keys that are these five words whose associated
values are the lengths of these words. Because dicts aren't ordered, it could
print as {'four': 4, 'three': 5, 'one': 3, 'five': 4, 'two': 3}

Finally, we can write a nested comprehensions, although they are harder to
understand than simple comprehensions.

x = {c for word in ['i', 'love', 'new', 'york'] for c in word if c not in 'aeiou'}
print(x)

It says to collect c's, by looking in each word w in the list, and looking at
each character c in each word: so the c collected at the beginning is the c
being iterated over in the second part of the comprehension (c in word...)

It prints a set of each different letter that is not a vowel, in each word
in the list. I could produce this same result by rewriting the outer part of the
comprehension as a loop, but leaving the inner one as a comprehension (union
merges two sets: does a bunch of adds).

x = set()
for word in ['i', 'love', 'new', 'york']:
    x = x.union( {c for c in word if c not in 'aeiou'} )
print(x)

or write it with no comprehensions at all

x = set()
for word in ['i', 'love', 'new', 'york']:
    for c in word:
        if c not in 'aeiou':
            x.add(c)
print(x)

So which of these is the most comprehendable: the pure comprehension, the
hybrid loop/comprehension, or the pure nested loops? What is important is that
we know how all three work, can write each correctly in any of these ways,
and then we can decide afterwords which way we want the code to appear. As we
program more, our preferences might change. I'd probably prefer the first one
(because I've seen lots of do9uble comprehensions), but the middle one is
also reasonable.

What do you think the following nested (in a different way) comprehension
produces?

x = {word : {c for c in word} for word in ['i', 'love', 'new', 'york']}

Check you answer by executing this code in Python and printing x.

Finally, here is a version of myprint (written above in the section on the
binding of arguments and parameters) that uses a combination of the .join
function and a comprehension to create the string to print simply.

The .join function (discussed more in depth below) joins all the string values
in an iterable into a string using the prefix operator as a separator:
'--'.join( ('My', 'dog', 'has', 'fleas') )
returns the string 'My--Dog--has--fleas'

def myprint(*args,sep=' ',end='\n'):
    s = sep.join(str(x) for x in args)+end       # create string to print
    print(s,end='')				 # print the string

WARNING: Once students learn about comprehensions, sometimes they go a bit
overboard as they learn about this feature. Here are some warning signs: When
writing a comprehension, you should (1) use the result produced in a later part
of the computation and (2) typically not mutate anything in the comprehension.
If the purpose of your computation is to mutate something, don't use a
comprehension. Over time you will develop good instincts for when to use
comprehensions.


Tuple Comprehensions are special:

The result of a tuple comprehension is special. You might expect it to produce
a tuple, but what it does is produce a special "generator" object that we can
iterate over. We will discuss generators in detail later in the quarter, so for
now we will examine just some simple examples. Given the code

x = (i for i in 'abc')  # tuple comprehension
print(x)

You might expect this to print as ('a', 'b', 'c') but it prints as
<generator object <genexpr> at 0x02AAD710>

The result of a tuple comprehension is not a tuple: it is actually a generator.
The only thing that you need to know now about a generator now is that you can
iterate over it, but ONLY ONCE. So, given the code

x = (i for i in 'abc')
for i in x:
    print(i)
for i in x:
    print(i)

it prints
a
b
c

Yes, it prints a, b, c and just prints it once: after the first loop finishes,
the generator is exhausted so the second loop prints no more values.

Recall our discussion of changing any iterable into a list, tuple, set; so if
we wrote t  = tuple(x) or t = tuple( (i for i in 'abc') ), then
print(t) would print ('a', 'b', 'c'). In fact, we could even write
t = tuple(i for i in 'abc') because by default, comprehensions are tuple
comprehensions.

Of course, we could also write things like 
l = list(i for i in 'abc')
s = set (i for i in 'abc')

but these are equivalent to writing the standard comprehensions more simply:
l = [i for i in 'abc']
s = {i for i in 'abc'}

	<a name="functions"><h1>Nine Important/Useful Functions: split/join, any/all, sum/min/max, zip/enumerate</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The split/join methods

Both split and join are methods in the str class: if s is some string, we call
them by writing s.split(...) or s.join(....)

The split method takes one str argument as .... and the result it returns is a 
list of of str. For example 'ab;c;ef;;jk'.split(';') returns the list of st

['ab', 'c', 'ef', '', 'jk']

It uses the argument str ';' to split up the string (prefixing the .split call),
into slices that come before or after every ';'.

Note that there is an empty string between 'ef' and 'j' because two adjacent
semi-colons appear between them in the string. If we wanted to filter out such
empty strings, we can easily do so by embedding the call to split inside a
comprehension: writing [s for s in 'ab;c;ef;;jk'.split(';') if s != '']
produces the list ['ab', 'c', 'ef', 'jk'].

Because the prefix and regular arguments are both strings, students sometime
reverse these two operands: what does ';'.split('ab;c;ef;;jk') produce and why?

The split method is very useful for reading lines of text from a file and then
parsing (splitting) these lines into their important constituent information.
You will use split in all 5 parts of Programming Assignment #1.

-----

The join method takes one iterable (producing str) argument as ....; the result
it returns is a str. For example ';'.join(['ab', 'c', 'ef', '', 'jk']) returns
the str

'ab;c;ef;;jk'

It merges all the strings in its argument list into one big string, with all the
strings from argument list concatenated together and separated from each other
by the ';' string.

So, split and join are opposites. Unfortunately, the splitting/joining string
';' appears as the argument inside the () in split, but it appears as the prefix
argument before the call in join. This inconsistency can be confusing.

	<a name="allAny"><h1>The all/any functions (and their use with tuple comprehensions)</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The "all" function takes one iterable argument (and returns a bool value): it
returns True if ALL the bool values produced by the iterable are True; it can
stop examining values and return a False result when the first False is produced
(ultimately, if no False is produced it returns True).

The "any" function takes one iterable argument (and returns a bool value): it
returns True if ANY the bool values produced by the iterable are True; it can
stop examining values and return a True result when the first True is produced
(ultimately, if no True is produced it returns False).

These functions can be used nicely with tuple comprehensions. For example, if
we have a list l of numbers, and we want to know whether all these numbers are
prime, we can call

  all( predicate.is_prime(x) for x in l )

which is the same as calling

  all( (predicate.is_prime(x) for x in l) )

and similar (but more time/space-efficient) than calling

  all( [predicate.is_prime(x) for x in l] )

The list comprehension computes the entire list of boolean values and then
"all" iterates over this list. When "all" iterates over a tuple comprehension,
the tuple comprehension computes values one at a time and "all" checks each: if
one is False, the tuple comprehension returns False immediately and does not
have to compute any further values in the tuple comprehension. Likewise for
the "any" function, which produces True the first time it examines a True value.

Here is how we can write these functions, which search for a False and True
respectively:

def all(iterable):
    for v in iterable:
        if v == False
            return False
    return True

def any(iterable):
    for v in iterable:
        if v == True
            return True
    return False

	<a name="morefunc"><h1>The sum/max/min functions (and their use with tuple comprehensions)</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The simple versions of the sum function takes one iterable argument. The sum
function requires that the iterable produce numeric values that can be added.
It returns the sum of all the values produced by the iterable; if the iterable
argument produces no values, sum returns 0. Actually, we can supply a second
argument to the sum function; in this case, that value will be returned when
the iterable produces no values and if the iterable does produce values, the
sum will be the actual sum plus this argument. We can think of sum as defined
by

def sum(values,init_sum=0):
    result = init_sum
    for v in values:
        result += v
    return result

The simple versions of the max and min functions also each take one iterable
argument.

The min/max functions require that the iterable produce values that can be
compared with each other; so calling min([2,1,3]) returns 1; and calling
min(['b','a','c') returns 'a';  but calling min([2,'a',3]) raises a TypeError
exception because Python cannot compare an integer to a string. These functions
return the minimum/maximum value produced by their iterable argument; if the
iterable produces no values (e.g., min([]), min and max each raise a ValueError
exception, because there is no minimum/maximum value that it can compute/return.

There are two more interesting properties to learn about the min and max
functions.

First, we can also call min/max specifying any number of arguments: so calling
min([1,2,3,4]) -using a tuple which it iterable- produces the same result as
calling min(1,2,3,4) -using 4 arguments.

We can also specify a second argument in min/max: a key function like the key
function used in sort/sorted. The min/max functions return the smallest/largest
value in its argument(s), but if the key function is supplied, it compares two
values by calling the key function on each.

For example, min('abcd','xyz') returns 'abcd', because 'abcd' < 'xyz'. But if
we instead wrote min('abcd','xyz',key = lambda x : len(x)) it would return 'xyz'
because len('xyz') < len('abcd'): that is, it compares the key function applied
to all values in the iterable to determine which value to return.

Note that min('abcd','wxyz',key = lambda x : len(x)) will return 'abcd' because
it is the first value that has the smallest result when the key function is
called: the key function returns 4 for both values. We can think of the min
function operating on an iterable to be written as follows (although we will
learn Python features later on that simplifies the actual definition of this
function)

def min(iterable,key = lambda x : x): 
    empty   = True

    for v in iterable:
        if empty:
            minimum  = v
            empty    = False            # At least one value in iterable
        elif key(v) < key(minimum):
            minimum = v

    if empty
        raise ValueError('min() arg is an empty sequence')
    else:
        return minimum

Calling min(('abc','def','gh','ij'),key = lambda x : len(x)) returns 'gh'. Note
that the default value for the key function is a lambda that returns the value
it is passed.

	<div class="top"><h4><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></h4></div>

	<a name="zip"><h1>The zip and enumerate functions</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Zip:

There is a very interesting function called zip that takes an arbitrary number
of iterable arguments and zips/interleaves them together (like a zipper does
for the teeth on each side). Let's start by looking at just the two argument
version of zip.

What zip actually produces is a generator -the ability to get the results of
zipping- not the result itself. See the discussion above about how tuple
comprehensions produce generators.

So to "get the result itself" we should use a for loop or constructor (as shown
in most of the examples below) to iterate over the generator result of calling
zip. The following code

z = zip( 'abc', (1, 2, 3) )           # String and tuple are iterator arguments
print('z:', z, 'list of z:', list(z))

prints

z: <zip object at 0x02A4D990> list of z: [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]

Here, z refers to a zip generator object; the result of using z in the list
constructor is [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)] which zips/interleaves the values
from the first iterable and the values from the second:
[(first from first,first from second),(second from first,second from second),  
 (third from first,third from second)]

What happens when the iterables are of different lengths? Try it.

z = zip( 'abc', (1, 2) )  # String and tuple for iterables
print(list(z))		  # prints [('a', 1), ('b', 2)]

So when one iterable runs out of values to produce, the process stops. Here is
a more complex example with three iterable parameters of all different sizes.
Can you predict the result it prints: do so, and only then run the code.

z = zip( 'abcde', (1, 2, 3), ['1st', '2nd', '3rd', '4th'] )
print(list(z))

Of course, this generalizes for any number of arguments, interleaving them all
(from first to last) until any iterable runs out. So the number of values in
the result is the minimum of the number of values of the argument iterables.

Note one very useful way to use zip: suppose we want to iterate over values in
two iterables simultaneously, i1 and i2, operating on the first pair of values
in each, the second pair of values in each, etc. We can use zip to do this by
writing:

for v1,v2 in zip(i1,i2):
    process v1 and v2: the next pair of values in each

So

for v1,v2 in zip ( ('a','b','c'), (1,2,3) ):
    print(v1,v2j)

prints

a 1
b 2
c 3

We can write a function that computes the equivalent of the < (less than)
operator for strings in Python (see the discussion above) easily by using zip.

def less_than(s1 : str, s2 : str)-> bool:
    for c1,c2 in zip(s1,s2):   # examine 1st, 2nd, ... characters of each string
        if c1 != c2:           # if current characters are different
            return c1 < c2     #   compute result by comparing characters

    # if all character from the shorter are the same (as in 'a' and 'ab')
    # return a result based on the length of the strings
    return len(s1)< len(s2)


Enumerate:

Finally, this is a convenient time to toss in another important function:
enumerate. It also also produces a generator as a result, but has just one
iterable argument, and an optional 2nd argument that is a starting number. It
produces tuples whose first values are numbers (starting at the value of the
second parameter; omit a 2nd parameter and unsurprisingly, the starting number
is 0) and whose second values are the values in the iterable. So, if we write

e = enumerate(['a','b','c','d'], 5)
print(list(e))

it prints [(5, 'a'), (6, 'b'), (7, 'c'), (8, 'd')]

Given l = ['a','b','c','d','e'] we could write the following code

for i in range(len(l)):
    print(i+1,l[i])

(which prints 1 a, 2 b, 3 c, 4 d, and 5 e on separate lines) more simply by
using enumerate:

for i,x in enumerate(l,1):
     print(i,x)

Another nice example illustrating enumerate is reading a file a line at a time,
and processing the line number and the line contents.

line_number = 1
for line in open("file-name"):
    .... process line_number and line
    line_number += 1

We can write just

for line_number, line in enumerate(open("file-name"),1):
    .... process line_number and line

You might ask now, why do these things (tuple comprehension, zip, enumerate)
produce generators and not just tuples or lists? That is an excellent question.
It goes right along with the excellent question why does sorted(...) produce a
list and not an iterable? We will discuss these issues later in the quarter.
It mostly has to do with space efficiency when iterating over many values.

	<div class="top"><h4><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></h4></div>

	<a name="kargs"><h1>**kargs for dictionary of not-matched named arguments in function calls</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Recall the use of *args in a function parameter list. We can also write the
symbol **kargs (we can write ** and any word, but kargs or kwargs are the
standard ones). If we use it to specify this kind of parameter, it must occur
as the last parameter. kargs stands for keyword arguments. Basically, if Python
has any  keywords arguments that do not match keyword parameters (see the large
discussion of argument/paramteter binding above, which includes *args but
doesn't include **kargs) they are all put in a dictionary that is stored in the
last parameter named kargs.

So, imagine we define the following function

def f(a,b,**kargs):
  print(a,b,kargs)

and call it by

f(c=3,a=1,b=2,d=4)

it prints: 1 2 {'c': 3, 'd': 4}

Using the rules specified before, Python would report a TypeError exception
(by rule M5(d)), because there are no parameter named a or b. 

By the new rules, Python finds two named arguments (c=3 and d=4) whose names
did not appear as paramter names in the function header of f (which specifies
only a and b, and of course the special **kargs), so while Python directly
binds a to 1 and b to 2 (the parameter names specified in the function header,
matched to similarly named arguments) it creates a dictionary with all the
other named arguments: {'c': 3, 'd': 4} and bound kargs to that dict.

The same result would be printed for the call

f(1,2,d=4,c=3)

We will use **kargs to understand a special use of of dict constructors (below).
We will also use **kargs (and learn something new in the process) when
discussing how to (1) call methods in decorators and (2) call overridden
methods using inheritance much later in the quarter.

Note that to write a perfectly general function that is called with any kinds
of arguments we can write

def g(*args,**kargs):
  print(args,kargs)

Now, any legal call of g (one with any legal combination of positional and
named arguments) will populate the *args and **kargs structures appropriately.

Calling

g(1,2,c=3,d=4)     prints (1, 2) {'c': 3, 'd': 4}
g(a=1,b=2,c=3,d=4) prints () {'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'a': 1, 'd': 4}


Generally, when a parameter name is prefixed by * and ** in a function header,
we omit the prefix when we use the parameter name. But there are times where
use use the * and ** prefixes.

def h(a,b,c,d):
    print(a,b,c,d)

def i(*args,**kargs):
  h(*args,**kargs)

The arguments *args and **kargs in the call of h expand the args tuple to
be positional arguments and the **kargs dictionary to be named arguments

Calling

i(1,2,c=3,d=4)     prints 1 2 3 4: it calls h(1,2,c=3,d=4)
i(a=1,b=2,c=3,d=4) prints 1 2 3 4: it calls h(c=3,b=2,a=1,d=4)

1) Writing * and ** when specifying parameters makes those parameters names
   bind to a tuple/dict respectively.

2) Using the parameter names by themselves in the function is equivalent to 
    using the tuple/dict respectively.

3) Using * and ** followed by the parameter name as arguments to function
   calls expands all the values in the tuple/dict respectively to represent
   all the arguments.

Experiment with *args/**kargs as parameters of functions and args/kargs and
*args/**kargs as arguments to other function calls.

		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
You need to have pretty good grasp of these important data types, meaning how to
construct them and the common methods/operations we can call on them. Really
you should get familiar with reading the online documentation for all these
data types (see the Python Library Reference link on the homepage for the
course).

4. 6: Sequence Types includes Lists (mutable) and Tuples (immutable)
4. 9: Set Types includes set (mutable) and frozenset (immutable)
4.10: Mapping Types includes dict and defaultdict (both mutable)

Here is a very short/condensed summary of these operations. Experiment with
them in Eclipse.

-----

4.6: Sequence Types includes Lists (mutable) and Tuples (immutable)
These sequence operations (operators and functions) are defined in 4.6.1
   x in s, x not in s, s + t, s * n, s[i], s[i:j], s[i:j:k], len(s), min(s), 
   max(s), s.index(x[, i[, j]]), s.count(x)

Mutable sequence allow the following operations, defined in 4.6.3
  s[i] = x , s[i:j] = t, del s[i], s[i:j:k] = t, del s[i:j:k], s.append(x)
  s.clear(), s.copy(), s.extend(t), s.insert(i, x), s.pop(), s.pop(i),
  s.remove(x), s.reverse()

  It also discusses list/tuple constructors and sort for list.

  note that the append method is especially important for building up sequences
  like lists. Also to return and remove a value from a sequence, we call
    x = s.pop(i)
  is equivalent to 
    x = s[i]
    del s[i]
  and calling s.pop() uses the value 0 (the first index in the sequence)

4. 9: Set Types includes set (mutable) and frozenset (immutable)
These set (operators and functions) are defined in 4.6.1.9
  len(s), x in s, x not in s, isdisjoint(other), issubset(other), set <= other, 
  set < other, issuperset(other), set >= other, set > other, union(other, ...),
  intersection(other, ...), difference(other, ...), symmetric_difference(other),
  copy; also the operators | (for union), & (for intersection), - (for
  difference), and ^ (for symmetic difference)

Sets, which are mutable, allow the following operations
  update(other, ...), intersection_update(other, ...),
  difference_update(other, ...), symmetric_difference_update(other), add(elem),
  remove(elem), discard(elem), pop(), clear(); also the operators |= (union
  update), &= (intersection update), -= (difference update), ^= (symmetric
  difference update)

-----

4.10: Mapping Types includes dict and defaultdict (both mutable)
These dict (operators and functions) are defined in 4.10
  d[key] = value , del d[key], key in d, key not in d, iter(d), clear(), copy(),
  fromkeys(seq[, value]), get(key[, default]), items(), keys(),
  pop(key[, default]), popitem(), setdefault(key[, default]), update([other]),
  values() 

Important Notes on dicts:
  d[k] returns the value associated with a key (raises exception if k not in d)

  d.get(k,default) returns d[k] if k in d; returns default if k not in d
    it is equivalent to the conditional expression (d[k] if k in d else default)

  d.setdefault(k,default) returns d[k] if k in d; if k not in d it
    (a) sets d[k] = default
    (b) returns d[k]
  writing d.setdefault(k,default) is equivalent to (but more efficient than)
  writing
      if k in d:
          return d[k]
      else
          d[k] = default
          return d[k]

There is a type called defaultdict (see 8.3.4) whose constructor generally
takes an argument that is a reference to any object that can be called with no
arguments. Very frequently we use name of a class that when called will
construct a new value: if the argument is int, it will call int() producing the
value 0; if the argument is list, it will call list() producing an empty list;
if the argument is set, it will call set() producing an empty set; etc.

Whenever a key is accessed for the first time (i.e., that key is accessed but
not already associated with a value in the dictionary) in a defaultdictionary,
it will associate that key with the value created by calling the reference to
the object supplied to the constructor.

Here is an example of defaultdict in action. Often it simplifies our use of
dictionaries.


from collections import defaultdict # in same module as namedtuple
letters = ['a', 'x', 'b', 'x', 'f', 'a', 'x']
freq_dict = defaultdict(int)   # int not int(); but int() returns 0 when called
for l in letters:
    freq_dict[l] += 1	       # in dict, exception raised if l not in d, but
print(freq_dict)                # defaultdict calls int() putting 0 there first

We could use a standard dict, but we would have to rewrite the code as follows
(which is a bit longer and less efficient too); defaultdict does the same thing,
but automatically.

letters = ['a', 'x', 'b', 'x', 'f', 'a', 'x']
freq_dict = dict()	       # note dict only
for l in letters:
    if l not in freq_dict:     # must check l in freq_dict before freq_dict[l]
        freq_dict[l] = int()   # int() constructor returns 0; could write 0 here
    freq_dict[l] += 1	       # l is guaranteed in freq_dict, either because
print(freq_dict)	   	       #  it was there originally, or put there

Another way to do the same thing (but also a bit longer and less efficient)
uses the setdefault method (listed above)

letters = ['a', 'x', 'b', 'x', 'f', 'a', 'x']
freq_dict = dict()	       # note dict only
for l in letters:
    freq_dict[l] = freq_dict.setdefault(l,0) + 1
print(freq_dict)	   	       

Here we evaluate the right side of the = first; if l is already in the dict,
its associated value is returned; if not, l is put in the map with an associated
value of 0, then this assocated value is returned (and incremented, and stored
back into freq_dict[l] replacing the 0 just put there).

You should achieve a good understanding of why each of these three scripts work
and why they alll produce equivalent results.

Often we use defaultdicts with list instead of int: just as int() produces the
object 0 associated with a new key, list() creates an empty list associated
with a new key (and later we add things to that list); likewise we can use
defaultdicts with set to get an empty set with a new key.

So, if we wrote x = defaultdict(list) and then wrote x['bob'].append(1) then
x['bob'] is associated with [1] (the empty list with 1 appended). If we then
wrote x['bob'].append(2), then x['bob'] is associated with [1, 2].

Just as with comprehensions, what is important is that we know how things like
defaultdicts and dicts (with the setdefault method) work, so that we can
correctly write code in any of these ways. We can decide afterwords which way
we want the code to appear. As we program more, our preferences might change.
I have found defaultdicts are mostly what I to use to simplify my code, byut
every so often I must use a regular dict.

Later in the quarter we will use inheritance to show how to write the
defaultdict class simply, by extending the dict class.

	<a name="ordered"><h1>Printing Dictionaries in Order</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
In this section we will combine our knowledge about the sorted function,
comprehensions, and iteratring over dictionaries to examine how we can print
(or generally process) dictionaries in arbitrary orders.

Generally, all of our code will be of the form

  for index(es) in sorted( iterable, key = lambda x : .... ):
     print( index(es) )

In these examples, we will use the simple dictionary

   d = {'x': 3, 'b': 1, 'a': 2, 'f': 1}

In each example, we will discuss the relationships among index(es), iterable,
and the lambda x : .... in the function bound to the key parameter.

1) In the first example, we will print the dictionary keys in increasing
alphabetical order, and their associated values, by iterating over d.items().

for k,v in sorted( d.items(), key = lambda item : item[0] ):
   print(k,'->',v)

which prints as

a -> 2
b -> 1
f -> 1
x -> 3

Here, iterable is d.items(), which produces 2-tuples storing each key and its
associated value, for every item in the dictionary; the item in lambda item is
also a key/value 2-tuple (specifying here to sort by item[0], the key part in
the 2-tuple); finally, the list returned by sorted also contains key/value
2-tuples, which are unpacked into k and v and printed.

We can solve this same problem by iterating over just the keys in d as well.

for k in sorted( d.keys(), key = lambda k : k ):
   print(k,'->',d[k])

Here, iterable is d.keys() which produces strings storing each key in the
dictionary; the k in lambda k is also a key/str value (specifying here to
sort by k, the key itself); finally, the list returned by sorted also contains
key/str value, which are stored into k and printed along with d[k].

This code is equivalent to the following, since d.keys() is the same a d, and
lambda x : x is the default for the key parameter.

for k in sorted( d ):
   print(k,'->',d[k])

2) In the second example, we will print the dictionary keys and their associated
values, in increasing order of the values, by iterating over d.items().

for k,v in sorted( d.items(), key = lambda item : item[1] ):
   print(k,'->',v)

which prints as

b -> 1
f -> 1
a -> 2
x -> 3

Here, iterable is d.items(), which produces 2-tuples storing each key and its
associated value, for every item in the dictionary; the item in lambda item is
also a key/value 2-tuple (specifying here to sort by item[1], the value part in
the 2-tuple); finally, the list returned by sorted also contains key/value
2-tuples, which are unpacked into k and v and printed.

We can solve this same problem by iterating over just the keys in d as well.

for k in sorted( d.keys(), key = lambda k : d[k] ):
   print(k,'->',d[k])

Here, iterable is d.keys() which produces strings storing each key in the
dictionary; the k in lambda k is also a key/str value (specifying here to sort
by d[k], the value associated with the key); finally, the list returned by
sorted also contains key/str values, which are stored into k and printed along
with d[k].

This code is equivalent to the following, since d.keys() is the same a d; the
lambda is still needed here.

for k in sorted( d, key = lambda k : d[k] ):
   print(k,'->',d[k])

3) In the third example, we will compute a list that contains all the keys in a
dictionary, sorted by their associated values (in decreasing order of the
values), by iterating over d.keys() (really just d, to simplify the code)

We compute

ks = sorted(d, key = lambda k : d[k], reverse = True)

ks stores ['x', 'a', 'b', 'f'].

We could also compute this list less elegantly using d.items().; I say less
elegantly, because we need a comprehension to "throw away" the value part of
each item returned by sorted.

ks = [k for k,v in sorted(d.items(), key=lambda item : item[1], reverse=True)]


4) Finally, in the fourth example, we will compute a list that contains all the
2-tuples in the items of d, but the tuples are reversed (values before keys) and
sorted in increasing alphabetical order by keys.

We compute this list of 2-tuple in the following two ways

vks = [ (v,k) for k,v in sorted( d.items(), key = lambda item : item[0]) ]
vks = sorted( ((v,k) for k,v in d.items()), key = lambda item : item[1])

vks stores [(2, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (1, 'f'), (3, 'x')]

The first computation creates a sorted version of d by keys, and then uses a
comprehension to reverse the keys/values in the tuples; the second computation
uses a comprehension to create a list of reversed keys/values, and then uses
sorted to sort these reversed 2-tuples by the keys in the second part of each
tuple.

	<a name="exceptions"><h1>Exceptions: example from prompt_for_int</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We do two things with exceptions in Python: we raise them (with the raise
statement) and we handle them (with the try/except statement). Exceptions were
not in early programming languages, but were introduced big time in the Ada
language in the early 1980s, and have been parts of most new languages since
then.

A function raises an exception if it cannot do the job it is being asked to
do. Rather than fail silently, possibly producing a bogus answer that gets used
to compute a bogus result, it is better that the computation announces a problem
occurred and if no way is know to recover from it (see handling exceptions
below) the computation halts with an error message to the user.

For example, if your program has a list l and you write l[5] but l has nothing
stored at index 5 (its length is smaller), Python raises the IndexError
exception. If you haven't planned for this possibility, and told Python how to
handle the exception and continue the calculation, then the program just
terminates and Python prints: 

IndexError: list index out of range

Why doesn't it print the index value 5 and the lenth of list l?. I don't know.
That certainly seems like important and useful information, and Python knows
those two values. I try to make my exception messages include any information
useful to the programmer.

There are lots of ways to handle exceptions. Here is a drastically simplified
example from my prompt class (this isn't the real code, but a simplification
for looking at a good use of exception handling). But it does a good job of
introducing the try/except control form which tries to execute a block of code
and handles any exceptions it raises.

If we write a try/except and specify the name of no exception, it will handle
any exception. The name Exception is the name of the most generic exception.

We can write a try/except statement with many excepts, each one specifying a 
specific exception to handle, and what to do when that exception is raised. In
fact, int('x') raises the ValueError exception, so I use ValueError in the
except clause below to be specific, and not accidentally handle any other kind
of exception.

def prompt_for_int(prompt_text):
    while True:
        try:
            response = input(prompt_text+': ')    # response is used in except
            answer = int(response)
            return answer
        except ValueError:
            print('  You bozo, you entered "',response,'"',sep='')
	    print('  That is not a legal int')

print(prompt_for_int('Enter a positive number'))

So, this is an "infinite" while loop, but there is a return statement at the
bottom of the try-block; if it gets executed, it returns from the function,
thus terminating the loop. The loop body is a try/except; the body of the
try/except

1) prompts the user to enter a string on the console (this cannot fail)

2) calls int(response) on the user's input (which can raise the ValueError
   exception, if the user types characters that cannot be interpreted as an
   integer)

3) if that exception is not raised, the return statement returns an int object
   representing the integer the user typed as a string

But if the exception is raised, it is handled by the except clause, which
prints some information. Now the try/except is finished, but it is in an
infinite loop, so it goes around the loop again, reprompting the user (over and
over until the user enters a legal int).

Actually, the body of try could be simplified (with the same behavior) to just

  response = input(prompt_text+': ')    # response is used in except
  return int(answer)

If an exception is raised while the return statement is evaluating the int
function, it still gets handled in except. We CANNOT write it in one line
because the name response is used in the except clause (in the first print).
If this WASN'T the case, we could write just

  return int(input(prompt_text+': '))    # if response not used in except

For example, we might just say 'Illegal input' in the except, but in the example
above, it actually display the string (not a legal int) that the user typed.

Finally, in Java we throw and catch exceptions (obvious opposites, instead of
raise and handle) so I might sometimes use the wrong term. That is because I 
think more generally about programming than "in a language", and translate what
I'm thinking to the terminology of the language I am using, but sometime I get
it wrong.

	<a name="namespace"><h1>Name spaces (for objects): __dict__</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Every object has a special variable named __dict__ that stores all its
namespace bindings in a dictionary. During this quarter we will systematically
study class names that start and end with two underscores. Writing x.a = 1
is similar to writing x.__dict__['a'] = 1; both associate a name with a value
in the object. We will explore the uses of this kind of knowledge in much more
depth later in the quarter.

Here is a brief illustration of the point above. Note that there is a small
Python script that illustrates the point. This is often the case.

class C:
    def __init__(self): pass

o = C()
o.a = 1
print(o.a)           # prints 1

o.__dict__['a'] = 2
print(o.a)           # prints 2

o.__dict__['b'] = 3
print(o.a,o.b)       # prints 2 3

	<a name="trivial"><h1>Trivial Things</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
An empty dict is created by {} and empty set by set() (we can't use {} for an
empty set because Python would think it is a dict). Any non-empty dicts can
be distinguished from a non-empy set because a non-empty dict will always have
the : character inside {} separating keys from values.

A one value tuple must be written like (1,) with that "funny" comma (we can't
write just (1) because that is just the value 1, not a tuple storing just 1).

	<a name="questions"><h1>Questions</h1>
		<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
1. Describe, in term of binding, what happens if the first statement in a
module is x = 0, in terms of the module object and its namespace.

2. Assume that we have executed the statement x = 1. Describe, in terms of
binding, what is the semantics of the statement x += 1.

3. What is printed in print(f(0)) if we define f as follows?

  def f(x):
      pass

4. Using the kind of pictures dicussed inthe Binding section above, illustrate
the meaning of a module named m that contains the following statements:

  x = 1
  y = 2
  z = y

And a module named script that contains the following statements:

  import m
  a = m.x
  m.y = 10
  from m import y
  from m import z as b
  z = y
  del m.z
  c = 10

The result will be two large rounded-rectangles (objects for modules m and 
script) which contain labeled boxes that refer to other rounded-rectangles
(objects for int values), some of which are shared (referred to by multiple
names)

5. Predict what the following script will produce and explain why.

print(print(5))
print=1
print(print)

6a. Write a simple function named count that returns the number of times a value
is in a list; write the a simple function named indexes that returns a list of
indexes in a list that a value returns. Use the appropriate kind of for loop.
For example, count(5, [5,3,4,5,1,2,5]) returns 3; indexes(5, [5,3,4,5,1,2,5])
returns [0,3,6].

7. Suppose that we define the functions double, triple, and magnitude (as done
above). Write the function call, such that call('double',5) returns the result
double(5); call('triple',5) returns the result triple(5); call('magnitude',5)
returns the result magnitude(5). Hint: use eval.

8. Write a function named between that is defined with two parameters. It
returns a reference to a function that has one parameter, which returns whether
or not its one parameter is between (inclusive) the two arguments supplied when
between is called. For example

college_age = between(18,22)
print( college_age(20) )

print True because 18 <= 20 <= 22.

9. Assume s = 'Fortunate'. Explain how Python evalues s.replace('t','c'). Sure,
the result it produces is 'Forcunace', but exactly how does Python know which
function to call and how to call that function with these arguments. Hint: Use
the Fundamenal Equation of Object-Oriented Programming.

9.5 This is tricky: it requires a good understanding of exec, eval, and what
characters really appear in strings when you type them on the console.
(1) prompt the user to enter a string that defines a function (using \n where
new lines would be in the function); (2) use exec to define the function;
(3) prompt the user to enter a call to the function and print what it evaluates
to. The interaction might look like:

Enter function definition as string: def f(n):\n    returns 2*n
Enter function call as string      : f(3)
6

Hint: when you enter \n in a string, what characters are entered? Use the
replace function to "fix" them to exec will work.

10. Assume that you have a list of tuples, where each tuple is a name and
birthday: e.g., ('alex', (9, 4, 1988)) and ('mark', (11, 29, 1990)). The
birthday 3-tuple, consists of a month, followed by day, followed by year. Write
a for-loop using sorted and a lambda to print out the tuples in the list in
order of their bithdays (just months and days) so the 'alex' tuple prints
before the 'mark' tuple because September 4th comes before November 29th; all
people who have the same birthday should be printed in alphabetical order.
Hint write a lambda that uses a key that is a person's month value, followed by
a day value, followed by a name value.

11. What does the following script print?

print('a','b','c',sep=��x��)
print('d','e','f',sep='')
print('g','j','i',sep=':',end=��:��)
print('j','k','l',sep='--',end='?')
print('m',end='\n\n')
print('n')

12. Assume s is a string. What is the value of s[-1:0:-1]? Assume l is a list.
Write the simplest loop that prints all values in a list except the first and
last (if the list has2 or fewer values, it should print nothing).

13. Write a single Python statement using a conditional expression that is
equivalent to the following two statementso

t= 0
if x < 0:
    t = -1

14. What can we say about
  len of set(d.keys())   compared to len of d.keys?
  len of set(d.values()) compared to len of d.values()?
  len of set(d.items())  compared to len of d.items()?

15. Assume we import the copy function from the copy module. What is the
difference between the result produced by list((1,2,3)) and copy((1,2,3))?

15.5 Using the kind of pictures dicussed inthe Binding section above, illustrate
the meaning of the following and determine what is printed.

  x = [ [0], [1]]
  y = list(x)
  x[0][0] = 'a'
  print(x,y)

16a. Assume we have a list of students (ls) and a list of their gpas (lg).
Create a dictionary whose first key is the first student in ls and whose
associated value is the first gpa in the lg; whose second key is the second
student in ls and whose associated value is the second gpa in the lg; etc.
So if ls = ['bob','carol','ted','alice'] and lg = [3.0, 3.2, 2,8, 3.6] the
resulting dict might print as {'carol': 3.2, 'ted': 2, 'alice': 8, 'bob': 3.0}.
Hint: use the dict constructor and the zip function.

16b. Assume that we have a list of runners in the order they finished the race.
For example ['bob','carol','ted','alice']. Create a dictionary whose keys are
the students and whose values are the place in which they finished. For this
example the resulting dict might print as 
{'carol': 2, 'ted': 3, 'alice': 4, 'bob': 1}. Hint: use a comprehension and
enumerate.

16c. Assume that we have a list of values l and a function f, and we want to
define a function that computes the value x in l whose f(x) is the smallest.
For example, if l = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2] and def f(x) : return abs(x+1), then
calling min_v(l,f) would return -1. Hint: try to write the min_v function in one
line: a returns statement calling min, on a special comprehension, and indexing.

17. The following script uses many topics that are covered in the lecture.

Write a script that reads a multiline file of words separated by spaces
(no punctuation) and builds a dictionary whose keys are the words and whose
values are lists of the line numbers that the words are on (with no duplicate
line numbers in each list). Print all the words (in sorted order, one per line)
with the list of their line numbers afterwards. For example, the 3 line file

to be or
not to be
that is the question

would print as

be [1, 2]
is [3]
not [2]
or [1]
question [3]
that [3]
the [3]
to [1, 2]

My solution was 8 lines long (including one import). It used a defaultdict,
three loops, three function calls (open, enumerate, and sorted), and four
method calls (rstrip, split, append).</pre>
