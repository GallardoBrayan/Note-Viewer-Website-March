<a name="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
In the second lecture on trees we will learn how to use lists (sets, if ordering
among nodes is not important) to store N-ary trees (trees where each node has an
arbitrary number of children: 0 -for leaves- or more). We will also discuss
traversal orders for binary trees (from the previous lecture) and general trees
too.

The most common example of an N-ary tree is a file system. There is a root
folder which contain files and other folders (which can contain files and other
folders, etc.). 
</pre>

<a name="simple"><h1>Simple N-ary Trees</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The main way we will store N-ary trees is as a node containing both a value and
a list of non-empty subtrees (each itself a TN; no Nones). The length of each
list is the number of children/subtrees of the node represented by each TN. We
can use the following simple class to store this information.

class TN:
    def __init__(self, value, children = [] ):
        self.value     = value
	self.children  = children # set() when order of children is unimportant

We will discuss many operations on trees below, written as functions. We can
also define methods that implement these operations as methods in the TN class,
but prefer to uses functions here. First, here is an example of a simple
N-ary tree for storing bands and their members. This tree, even if we added
more bands and members, would always have a height of 2.

                                 Bands
                 /                        \                        \
           Beach_Boys                    Beatles                  Roches
   /     /     |   \   \              /    /  \     \          /     |   \
Brian Dennis Carl Mike Al         John Paul George Ringo   Maggie Terre Suzzy

Using the TN class, we represent this tree as the following TN objects. Each
TN object has a value and a list (potentially empty) of children/subtrees.

 TN('Bands',
    [TN('Beach_Boys',
          [TN('Brian'), TN('Dennis'), TN('Carl'), TN('Mike'), TN('Al')]
     TN('Beatles',
          [TN('John'), TN'Paul'), TN('George'), TN('Ringo')]
     TN('Roches',
          [TN('Maggie'), TN('Terre'), TN('Suzzy')]
    ]

Notice that each TN constructor with two arguments is a string followed by a
list of TN. The TN constructors with one argument is just a string, and no list
of children (so the empty list of children -the default value in __init__) is
used.

Similarly to how we computed the height and size of binary trees, we can compute
these quantities for N-ary trees. The code for both mixes iteration (to produce
all the children of a node) and recursion (to process each child's subtree).

Here are these method written with simple Python constructs. Note that we
assume that atree is a TN: each recursive call is also guaranteed to be a
TN, from the list of children (we don't need the conventional base cases needed
in recursion; or, we can think of leaf nodes -those with no children- as base
cases): e.g., in the size function, if atree has no children (the base case),
then the loop executes 0 times and the count of that one TN is 1; in the height
function, if atree has no children (the base case), then the loop executes 0
times and the height of that one TN is 0 (-1 + 1).

So in both cases, the base case is not explicit, but results in no loop
executions.

def size(atree): 
    count = 1
    for c in atree.children:
        count += size(c)
    return count

def height(atree):
    h = -1
    for c in atree.children:
        h = max(h,height(c))
    return 1 + h

We can reduce the code in these functions (not sure if this simplifies them in
terms of understanding them) by using Pythons sum/max functions (which operate
on arguments to iterate over) and comprehensions which accumulate the values
of the recursive calls on all the children/subtrees.

def size(atree): 
    return 1 + sum( size(c) for c in atree.children )

def height(atree):
    if atree.children == []:
        return 0
    else:
       return 1 + max( height(c) for c in atree.children )

Note that the sum function returns 0 for an empty argument list (which produces
the correct answer). But the max function raises a ValueError when its argument
list is empty. If we defined emax to generalized max, allowing us to specify
what value emax should return for an empty argument list

def emax(*args,empty = None):
    if args == ():
         return empty
    else:
        return max(*args)

then we could likewise simplify height (whose if was needed in case that
atree.children was empty). Here if atree.children is empty, emax returns 0
(so, it uses an if inside emax's defintion).

def height(atree):
    return emax( (height(c)+1 for c in atree.children), 0 )

We can use nested lists in Python to represent trees as well. For the tree above
we would represent it as follows.

 ['Bands',
   ['Beach_Boys',
      ['Brian'], ['Dennis'], ['Carl'], ['Mike'], ['Al']
   ],
   ['Beatles',
      ['John'], ['Paul'], ['George'], ['Ringo']
   ],
   ['Roches',
      ['Maggie'], ['Terre'], ['Suzzy']
   ]
  ]

Here, the value at the root of a subtree is always followed by a list of
its subtrees (also in this list form). So 'Bands' is followed by a list of
3 bands; the first band, 'Beach_Boys', is followed by a list of its 5 member;
each member is list that is a name followed by no other values (a 1-list).

We can write short recursive functions to translate between these two 
representations. Again, we see the combination of iteration (in a comprehension)
to produce all the children of a node, with recursive calls of the function on
each child. Note that if alist has just one value, alist[1:] is an empty list.

def list_to_tree(alist):
    if alist == []:
        return []
    else:
        return TN(alist[0], [list_to_tree(x) for x in alist[1:]])
    
def tree_to_list(atree): 
    return [atree.value]+[tree_to_list(c) for c in atree.children]
    
The project file accompanying this lecture includes a version of print_tree for
N-ary trees. For every node, it recursively prints 1/2 its children, then the
node's value, then recursively prints the other 1/2 of its children. There is a
problem though. For the above it prints as follows

....Brian
....Dennis
..Beach_Boys
....Carl
....Mike
....Al
Bands
....John
....Paul
..Beatles
....George
....Ringo
....Maggie
..Roches
....Terre
....Suzzy

and when this tree is rotated 90 clockwise, it is not obvious where the (left)
members of the Beatles ends and the (right) members of the Roches begins.

If we want to determine whether a value is in an N-ary we can define the
following function. Because there is generally no order property on N-ary
trees (unlike binary search trees) we must search all children of each node, if
the value is not at the node. This requires many recursive calls.

def contains(atree,value):
    return atree.value == value or\
           any( contains(c,value) for c in atree.children )

The any function returns True if its argument iterator (here a tuple) produces
one True value (in this case, any won't produce any more values to check); if
the iterator terminates before producing any value, any returns False. So,
value is contained in atree if it is the value at the root of the tree or if it
is contained in any of the subtrees.

The find function searches the N-ary atree and returns a reference to the node
containing value, or None if value is not found anywhere in atree. Here we will
assume that every value in the N-ary tree is unique.

def find(atree,value):
    if atree.value == value:
        return atree
    else:
        for c in atree.children:
            answer = find(c,value)
            if answer != None:
                return answer
        return None

In find we search for the value in the tree, much like we did in contains. But,
instead of returning a bool value, if we find a TN with value, we return the TN
(and don't recur any deeper). If we don't find that value in this TN, we iterate
through its children, trying to find the value in each subtree. For most
subtrees (which don't contain the value) the recursive call will return None;
but if a non-None value is returned in a recursive call, that value is found
so it is returned for the current TN. If the answer for each recursive call on
the subtrees is None, eventualy the loop terminates and this function returns
None.

Let's look at one more function: finding all the ancestors of a value in a tree.
The ancestors of a node are its parent, its parent's parent, etc., all the way
back to the root of a tree. To simplify this function, we will also consider a
value to be an ancestor of itself. Here we will also assume that every value in
the N-ary tree is unique.

def ancestors(atree,value):
    if atree.value == value:
        return [value]
    else:
        for c in atree.children:
            answer = ancestors(c,value)
            if answer != []:
                return [atree.value] + answer
        return []

This function operates very similarly to the find function discussed above.
In ancestors we search for the value in the tree, much like we did in contains
and find. But instead of returning a bool value or the TN, if we find the
value we return a list with just that value (and don't recur any deeper). If we
don't find that value in this TN, we iterate through its children, computing the
ancestors in each subtree. For most subtrees (which don't contain the value) the
recursive call will return []; but if a non-empty list is returned, the value
was in that subtree, so the value of the current TN is an ancestor, so a list
containing the value of the current TN is prepended to the list of ancestors,
and this new list is returned. If the answer for each recursive call on the
subtrees is empty, eventualy the loop terminates and this function returns an
empty list.

<a name="traversal"><h1>Traversal Orderings</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
There are four traversal orderings that apply to binary trees: preorder,
inorder, postorder, and breadth-first order. In the first three cases, the word
before order determines when a parent node is processed compared to its
children.

1) Preorder: process the value in the parent node first, then recursively
     process its left and right subtrees; typically we process the left subtree
     before the right subtree, although we can talk about reverse preorder,
     which processes the right subtree before the left subtree.

2) Inorder: recursively process the left subtree first, then process the value
     in the parent node, then recursively process its right subtree; ditto for
     standard and reverse ordering

3) Postorder: recursively process the left and right subtrees first, then
     process the value in the parent node; ditto for standard and reverse
     ordering (see Preorder)

4) breadth-first order: process all the nodes at depth 0 (just the root), then
     all at depth 1, then all at depth 2, etc.

For the binary search tree:

                                    43
                               /            \
                          15                 60
                        /   \               /   \
                      8      30            50    82
                            /  \                 /
                          20   35               70

Here are these four different orders.

Preorder            : 43, 15,  8, 30, 20, 35, 60, 50, 82, 70
Inorder		    :  8, 15, 20, 30, 35, 43, 50, 60, 70, 82 
Postorder	    :  8, 20, 35, 30, 15, 50, 70, 82, 60, 43
Breadth-first order : 43, 15, 60,  8, 30, 50, 82, 20, 35, 70

The project downloaded for the previous trees lecture includes the methods
generator_preorder, generator_inorder, generator_postorder, and
generator_breadth_first, all are generators that can all be used with iterators
trivially:

  for v in generator_inorder(atree):
      print(v)

The preorder, inorder, and postorder generators all look the same: using
two loops on recursive calls for iterating over subtrees: it is just WHERE
the yield atree.value appears compared to these loops: pre/before the loops,
in-between the loops, post/after the loops. The breadth-first order generator
uses a single loop and a list of the nodes to visit (in depth-first order).

The N-ary tree versions are similar, although there is no equivalent for inorder
traveral when there are arbitrary number of children/subtrees. These appear in
the project folder for this lecture

<a name="problems"><h1> Problems</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
1) Define a recursive function named nodes_at_depth which takes an N-ary tree
and a non-negative integer as arguments; it returns a list of all the nodes in
the tree at the specified depth. Not a depth of 0 is the root; a dept of 1 is
all nodes that are children of the root, etc.

2) Define a function named common_ancestors which takes an N-ary tree and two
values in the tree as arguments; it returns a list of nodes that are ancestors
common to both values in the tree. In the bands tree 'Paul' and 'John' have
['Bands','Beatles'] as common ancestors; 'Maggie' and 'Paul' have just ['Bands']
as common ancestors. Hint, use the ancestors function and a nested prefix_equal
function which takes two lists as parameters and returns their common prefix:
e.g.,  prefix_equal( ['a', 'b', 'x', 'y'], ['a', 'b', 'c', 'y'] ) returns
['a', 'b'].

3) Define a function named add_up which takes an N-ary tree whose values are
integers; it returns the sum of all the values in the tree.

4) Define two recursive functions named sort_m and sort, which each take an
N-ary tree as an argument. The sort_m version mutates the tree so that for
every node, its list of children are sorted (by the .value attribute of each
child TN); the sort version returns a new N-ary tree with this property, while
not mutating its N-ary tree argument.

5) Characterize the traversal orders for the following functions
   a) The print_tree function for binary trees.
   b) The evaluate function for expression trees
What traversal orders (where processing a node is printing its value) could we
use print a binary search tree into a file, and then read the file (adding each
node as it is read) to an empty binary search to reconstruct the structure of
the original tree?
