<a name="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
In this lecture we upgrade our discussion of self-referential structures from
linked lists to trees, by creating TN: a class that includes a value and two
references to other objects from the TN class (or None). What seems like a
trivial extension turns out to be profound: like going from a 1-dimensional
space to a 2-dimensional space. There are entire books written about trees
(in both computer science and mathematics), but no books written solely about
linked lists.

Over the next two lectures we will examine a few applications for trees. We will
discuss binary order trees (search trees) and structure trees (expression trees)
and discuss various recursive functions that operate on them. Both use the same
defintion of the TN (tree node) class shown below

class TN: # A binary tree: each TN has two children
    def __init__(self : TN ,value, left : TN = None, right : TN = None):
        self.value = value
	self.left  = left
	self.right = right

We will discuss many operations on trees below, written as functions. We can
also define methods that implement these operations as methods in the TN class.

Actually, because when defining TN we cannot use TN for an annotation, the above
class at best can be written

class TN: 
    def __init__(self ,value, left = None, right = None):
        self.value = value
	self.left  = left
</pre>

<a name="binarysearch"><h1>Binary Search Trees</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
A binary tree has a structure and order property. Its structure property
dictates that every parent node has 0, 1, or 2 children nodes (called left and
right; each is another binary tree or None). We draw binary trees with their
root on the top, their left and right children below, and their leaves at the
bottom (a leaf is a node with 0 children: self.left and self.right are None; an
internal node has at least one non_None child). A binary search tree also has
an order property that dictates that all values in the left subtree of any node
are less than that node, and all values in the right subtree of any node is
greater than that node. Typically binary search trees have unique values (and
we will assume so in this lecture).

Structurally, binary trees are much more interesting than linked lists:
structurally (ignoring values) there is only one linked list of length 4:

     x
   +---+    +---+---+    +---+---+    +---+---+    +---+---+
   | --+--->| ? | --+--->| ? | --+--->| ? | --+--->| ? | / |
   +---+    +---+---+    +---+---+    +---+---+    +---+---+

But there are 14 different binary trees with four nodes. Here is a listing of
all 14. They are arranged in two groups, such that in each group a tree and its
mirror image are above/below each other.

       ?                ?                ?
      / \              / \              /

         \                 \             /                   / 
          ?                 ?           ?                   ?
           \               /             \                 /
            ?             ?               ?               ?


Note that the shape of a binary search trees is not uniquely determined by the
values it contains. For example, a tree with the values 1, 2, 3, and 4 can be
represented by

      3              2                 4
    /   \          /   \              /
   1    4    or   1     3      or    1     or ... any of the 14 structures above
     \                   \            \
       2                  4            3
                                      /
                                     2

Note that for every node in the binary search trees above (not just the root),
the parent is > all values in its left subtree and < all values in its right
subtree.

Later, when we study the add function, we will learn that the shape of a binary
search tree is determined by the order in which the values in a binary tree are
added.

There is just one standard metric for linked lists: length. For trees there are
two standard metrics: size and height. Size counts the number of nodes in a
tree (therefore it is similar to length for linked lists). It is easily to
compute size recursively, using a function similar to a recursive computation
of the length of a list (but with two recursive call -one for each subtree-
instead of one -for the nodes following in the list).

def size(atree):
    if atree == None:
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 + size(atree.left) + size(atree.right)

There is no simple way to compute size with a loop: for every node in the tree
we must visit both its left and right subtrees, so every time that we go left
we must also save the right for future reference so we can go there too; we can
write this function iteratively by using an extra list of nodes, but the code
is not simple to write nor easy to understand.

def size_i(atree)
    nodes = []
    size = 0
    nodes.append(atree)
    while len(nodes) > 0:
        next = nodes.pop(0)
        if next != None:
            size += 1
            nodes.append(next.left)
            nodes.append(next.right)
    return size

The second metric for trees is height. The standard definition of the height of
a node is a bit strange: it is the number of steps needed to get from the node
to the deepest leaf in either of the node's subtrees. So the height of a leaf
(the base case) is 0 and the height of a tree is the height of its root. We can
directly translate this definition into the following code. Again there are (at
most) two recursive calls, in the case of a node with two non-None children.

def height(atree)
   if atree.left == None and atree.right == None:   # leaf check as base case
       return 0
   elif atree.left == None:			    # only a left subtree
       return 1 + height(atree.right);
   elif atree.right == None:			    # only a right subtree
       return 1 + height(atree.left);
   else					            # both a left/right subtree
       return 1 + max(height(atree.left),height(atree.right));

This function deals with all the necessary cases: a leaf node, an internal node
with only a left (or only a right) subtree, and an internal node with both left
and right subtrees. This function does not work on empty trees, which have no
directly defined height from the previous definition.

But, this code is much more complicated than the code for computing size. The
complexity results from using a leaf node as the base case. Let us simplify
this code by using an empty tree as a base case, and "arbitrarily" defining the
height of an empty tree to be -1. This might seem like a very strange approach,
but it seems reasonable too: an empty tree should have a height that is one
less than a leaf node (whose height is 0). By using this definition (and no
others), we can simplify the height function dramatically (as well as defining
it for all possible trees, even empty ones).

def height(atree):
    if atree == None:
        return -1
    else:
        return 1 + max(height(atree.left),height(atree.right))

Mathematicians generalize definitions such as this one all the time. For any
value a, a**0 is defined as 1. There are many ways to justify this definition
(some quite complicated, using limits and calculus); the simplest way is to
note the algebraic law a**x * a**y = a **(x+y). By this law (a quite useful one
to have) a**0 * a**x = a**(0+x) = a**x; which means that a**0 must be equal to
1 for this identity to hold.

If we couldn't guess that -1 was the correct answer, we could deduce it. If
we started by writing 

def height(atree):
    if atree == None:
        return empty-height
    else:
        return 1+ max(height(atree.left),height(atree.right))

and looked at height called on a leaf node (which we know must compute a height
of 0), we would have

   0 = 1 + max(height(None),height(None))  # height(None) because it is a leaf
  -1 = max(empty-height,empty-height)      # height(None) returns empty-height
  -1 = empty-height			   # max(x,x) = x for all x

The second line comes from subtracting 1 from each side and substituting
empty-height for each call to height(None); the third line comes from
simplifying that max(x,x) = x (the maximum of a value and itself is that value).
So, we have deduced (from the recursive call) what the base case (None) should
return.

Next we will look at functions that convert between trees and lists, showing
that there is a standard way to represent a tree as a nested list of values. We
represent every TN as a 3-list containing the value, left, and right subtrees
(each subtree is itself a 3-list). So, we represent the tree

         5
        / \
       3   8
   
by the list [5 [3 None None] [8 None None]]. Note that each list present always
has exactly 3 values (of which zero, one, or two are None): so each is a 3-list.

There are simple recursive functions to translate from a tree producing a list
and from a list producing a tree. Again, each uses two recursive calls

def list_to_tree(alist):
    if alist == None:
        return None
    else:
        return TN(alist[0],list_to_tree(alist[1]),list_to_tree(alist[2])) 

Each recursive call on a non-empty list builds a TN with a value (alist[0]),
and then produces subtrees from the next two values in the 3-list; eventually
None will be reached as base cases.

We can also easily translate from a tree (TN) to a list.

def tree_to_list(atree):
    if atree == None:
        return None
    else:
        return [atree.value,tree_to_list(atree.left),tree_to_list(atree.right)]

Each recursive call on a non-empty tree builds a 3-list of the value, followed
by the list equivalent of the left and right subtrees; eventually None will be
reached as base cases.

The following function prints a tree rotated 90 degree counter-clockwise. So
the tree we would show as

             30
          /      \
       15          50
    /     \      /    \
  10       25  35      70 
         /
       20

prints as follows. Notice where the root (30) appears, and where the roots of
its left (15) and right (50) subtrees appear, and the left/right roots of those
subtrees, etc.

....70
..50
....35
30
....25
......20
..15
....10

This function declares print_tree_1, as a local helper function that does all
the recursive work (using the indent_char/indent_delta parameters), and then
calls print_tree_1 with an initial identation of 0. The helper function
either does nothing (for printing an empty tree), or prints all values in
its right subtree (first, with more indentation), its own value, and then all
values in its left subtree (with more indentation).

def print_tree(atree,indent_char =' ',indent_delta=2):
    def print_tree_1(indent,atree):
        if atree == None:
            return None
        else:
            print_tree_1(indent+indent_delta, atree.right)
            print(indent*indent_char+str(atree.value))
            print_tree_1(indent+indent_delta, atree.left)
    print_tree_1(0,atree) 

At this point we have dealt with the structure of trees, but not their values.
In a binary search trees, we can use the value property to search for, add a
value, and remove a value efficiently: think of a tree representing a set of
values (each value in a set is unique; that mirrors our intent of having unique
values in binary trees).

We can use the following iterative function to search for a value; unlike the
other functions written above, this one goes only one way (left or right) for
each tree node. We know that if the value we are searching for is less than a
node's value, by the order property of a binary search tree it must be in the
left subtree; if the value we are searching for is greater than a node's value,
it must be in the right subtree.

def search_i(atree,value):
    while atree != None and atree.value != value:
        atree = atree.left if value < atree.value else atree.right
    return atree  # either None or the TN storing value
    
We can also write this function recursively.

def search(atree,value):
    if atree == None:
        return None
    if value == atree.value:
        return atree
    elif value < atree.value:
        return search(atree.left,value)
    else: # value > atree.value
        return search(atree.right,value)
    
and we can shorten this function to the following

def search(atree,value):
    if atree == None or atree.value == value
        return atree
    else:
        return search(atree.left if value < atree.value else atree.right ,value)

In the function above, the "base" case is an empty tree or the node storing the
value; the same recursive call is executed for subtrees, with the first
"smaller" tree (having fewer nodes) being either atree.left or atree.right.

Because this is a tail-recursive function, we expect to be able to write it
iteratively (as we did above).

Now, here is a similar (to the top) function to add a value to a tree. We call
it like: atree = add(atree,value) -similarly to how we added a value to a list.

def add(atree,value):
    if atree == None:
        return TN(value)
    if value < atree.value:
        atree.left = add(atree.left,value)
        return atree
    elif value > atree.value:
        atree.right = add(atree.right,value)
        return atree
    else:
        return atree  # already in tree; do not change the tree

In all cases, this function returns a tree to which a TN with value has been
added as a subtree. Note that if the node is None, it returns a reference to a
TN with value; if node is not empty, it returns that node, but either its left
of right subtree (as appropriate) now refers to a tree into which value has
been added.

Note that the structure of a tree is not determined solely by the values it
contains. As we saw above, there are many legal binary search trees with the
same values. The structure is determined by the order those values are added to
the tree. Adding values in increasing order, decreasing order, at random, will
all produce different shaped trees.

I will defer showing the remove function, but I will describe it here and you
should use this description to practice deleting values from trees (shown
pictorally). Use the following simple tree for a first example

             30
          /      \
       15          50
    /     \      /    \
  10       25  35      70 
         /
       20


Here are the rules:

1) To remove a value in a leaf, make its parent refer to None

2) To remove a value in a node with one child, make its parent refer to its
    child (this works whether the node is a left/right child of its parent, 
    and whether its child is a left/right child)

3) To remove a value in a node with 2 children:
      (a) Find the biggest node less than it (or smallest node greater than it)
            that node must have 0 or 1 children (can you explain why?)
      (b) Remove that node by rule 1 or 2
      (c) Take its value and put it as the value of the node being removed
          So the node being removed isn't really removed (another one is):
            but, its value is replaced by another value, so the value is removed

The first two rules are very simple. Here is an example of applying the third.
If we remove the value at the root, 30, we would (a) find the node 25,
(b) remove the value here by making 15's right refer to 20, (c) move the value
25 to the node that contains 30. Note the order property is preserved: all
values to the left of the node that used to store 30 are less than what it now
stores, 25 (25 was the biggest of the nodes < 30); all values to the right of
the node that used to store 30 are greater than what it now stores, 25 (25 is
< 30, so nodes > 30 are > 25).

             25
          /      \
       15          50
    /     \      /    \
  10       20  35      70 


The binarysearchtree module contains simple recursive functions for copying a
tree and determining whether two trees are equal (not only store the same
values, but store trees that have these values and the same shape). Examine
those functions (or better yet, try to write them yourself first).

Finally, the generator_in_order function generates all the values (from lowest
to highest) in the tree. In the next lecture we will study traversal orders 
more generally, discussing pre-order, post-order, and breadth-first order).

We can use binary search trees easily to create a dictionaries whose values are
always iterated over in a sorted order. The penalty for this constraint is that
the keys must all be comparable and the amount of time to search, add, and
remove are a bit higher than for dict (but still much less than using lists to
store such associations). ICS-46 covers runtime performance of lists, trees, and
hash tables (which is how Python actually stores sets and dictionaries).

It is easy to imagine how a binary search tree can store key-value pairs. We can
search a well-balanced tree (one that for each node has about as many values in
the left subtree as the right subtree) much faster than a linked list (even an
ordered one).

The amount of time it takes to search any binary search tree is bounded by its
height: the number of comparisons in needs to go downard in the tree until it
reaches the value it is searching for (or goes beyond a leaf, meaning that the
value is not in the tree).

The height of an N-node tree must be at least Log2 N (log base 2 of the number
of nodes in the tree). The typical height, when values are added randomly, is
2-3 times that. In a linked list (or pathological binary search tree) the
number of comparisons is N-1.

Try the following experiment, which prints the height of a tree with 1,000
values, added in a random order.

  values = [i for i in range(1000)]
  random.shuffle(values)
  print(height(add_all(None,values)))

The Log2 1000 is about 10, so the typical height of such a tree is about 20-30,
which means it takes 20 comparisons to find a value: much better than the
average of about 500 if the values are in an unordered list or linked-list.
Also, see the random_height function in the binarysearchtree.py module.

We will learn a bit more about this performance in ICS-33, but will learn much
more about it in ICS-46, and look at tree processing in more depth :) there.

<a name="expression"><h1>Expression Trees</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We can also use binary trees to represent expressions. In these trees, leaf
nodes represent values (either literals or names bound to values), and the
internal nodes represent binary operators or unary operators or unary functions
(whose operands will be in the right subtree). For example, the expression
(-b + sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c))/(2*a) would be represented by the expression tree.

                       '/'
            /                    \
           +                      *
      /         \                /  \
     -          sqrt            2    a
      \           \
       b           -
                /      \
               **       *
              /  \     / \ 
             b    2   *   c
                     / \
                    4   a

Here I wrote '/' for the divide operator, since / means a left subtree.

Note that the structure of the tree determines how the subexpressions are
computed. There is no need for operator precedence rules or parentheses: the
structure of the tree embodies these rules.

There is an algorithm that people can follow to construct such a tree: find the
last operator or function call the computer would evaluate and put that at the
root of the tree; now do the same for its one/two subtrees that are
subexpressions, and keep repeating finding the root of these until there are no
more operators or functions (names and literals stand for themselves). 

In the expression above, the division between the numerator and denominator is
evaluated last: on the left side the addition is evaluated last; on the right
side there is only the multiplications, so that is done last. Continue this
process. If we call print_tree on this tree, it would print

....a
..*
....2
/
..........c
........*
............a
..........*
............4
......-
..........2
........**
..........b
....sqrt
..+
......b
....-

Once we have such a tree, we can peform many operations on it. The first and
most important is evaluating the tree. We can do this recursively (evaluating
subexpressions) by
  (1) evaluating leaves as themselves
  (2) evaluating either unary operators on their evaluated operand or unary
        functions on their evaluated argument
  (3) evaluating binary operators on their evaluated arguments

The code for this method follows this outline

def evaluate(etree):
    #name/literal
    if etree.left == None and etree.right == None:
        return eval(str(etree.value))

    #unary operator/function cal
    elif etree.left == None:
        if etree.value in {'+','-'}:
            #unary operator
            return eval(etree.value + str(evaluate(etree.right)))
        else:
            #function call: assume legal name
            return eval(etree.value+'('+str(evaluate(etree.right))+')')
    else:
        #binary operator: assume etree.value in {'+','-','*','/','//','**'}

        return eval(str(evaluate(etree.left)) + etree.value + str(evaluate(etree.right)))

If we set a=1, b=2, c=1, the calcuated value is -1.

We can translate this tree into infix (but overparenthesized) and postfix form:
in the postfix form, each operator is proceeded by its two operands: a + 1
(infix form) translates to 1 a +. Using postfix notation (also called Polish
notation because it was invented by Polish logicians right before World War II),
we can write expressions unambiguously without any parentheses or knowledge of
operator precedence! Here are the functions to perform these translations, and
their results.

def infix(etree):
    if etree.left == None and etree.right == None:
        return '('+str(etree.value)+')'
    elif etree.left == None:
        return '('+etree.value+str(infix(etree.right))+')'
    else:
        return '('+str(infix(etree.left))+etree.value+str(infix(etree.right))+')'

which produces: (((-(b))+(sqrt(((b)**(2))-(((4)*(a))*(c)))))/((2)*(a)))
which is correctly but over parenthesized

def postfix(etree):
    if etree.left == None and etree.right == None:
        return str(etree.value)
    elif etree.left == None:
        return str(postfix(etree.right)) + ' ' + etree.value
    else:
        return str(postfix(etree.left)) + ' ' + str(postfix(etree.right)) + ' ' + etree.value

which produces: b - b 2 ** 4 a * c * - sqrt + 2 a * /

If you have never seen Polish notation this is difficult to read, but if you
have studied this notation, it is easy. To understand which operators apply to
which data, start on the left and circle each operand: when you get to an
operator circle it and the number of operands it takes (which all come before
it). Look at smalller examples: 1+2*3 is 123*+ while (1+2)*3 is 12+3*. The
operands in polish notation appear in the same order as regular notation, but
the operators appear in different spots based on operator precedence and
parentheses.

Finally, I have defined a parse_infix function that takes a string argument
and produces a tree representing the string. It is limited in the following
ways: all tokens must be separated by spaces; it assumes all operators are
binary, and that all operators are left-associative (which ** is not). So, it
does a bit of what Python does when it processes expressions written in Python,
but doesn't do everything correctly.

<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
1) Draw all 14 binary search trees with the values 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2) Define a function named mirror, which takes one binary tree argument and 
returns a binary tree that is its mirror image: for any node, its left and
right subtrees are switched (not just switched for the root, but switched for
every node in the tree).

3) Define a function named sum, which takes one binary tree argument and
returns the sum of all the node values.

4) Define a function named is_bst, which takes one binary tree argument and
returns whether or not the tree is a binary search tree (satisfies the order
property of binary search trees). It should return False for the following
tree (which violates the order property):      

                5
             /     
            3
              \
                8         

Hint: I used two helper functions: all_less and all_greater.

5) Define a function named all_satisfy, which takes two arguments: a binary
tree argument and an predicate; it returns whether or not the predicate
satisifies (returns True for) all values in the binary tree.
