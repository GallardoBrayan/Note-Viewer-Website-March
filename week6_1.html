<a name="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
ICS-46 is concerned with studying the lower-level data structures that are used
in Python to represent lists/tuples, dicts, sets/frozensets, and other
not-built-into Python named data-types: stacks, queues, priority-queues, 
equivalence classes, and graphs. There are two primary components to all these
data-types: arrays and self-referential data-structures. Linked lists are the
simplest kind of self-referential data-structures, and trees are more complex
self-referential data-structures.
 
Languages like Java/C++ don't build-in most of Python's useful data-types, but
instead provide them in standard libraries, which are a bit more awkward to use
than these data-types in Python. These data-type libraries are built on arrays
and self-referential structures. This week is a peek at self-referential
structures (the last week will be a peek at more of Java, and will address some
of these same issues in a larger context).
</pre>

<a name="ln"><h1>Class LN</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Here is the trivial class that serves as the basis for all our linked list code
(and the tree class isn't much different). LN stand for List Node: a linked
list is a sequence of list nodes one explicitly referring to the next (via a
next references).

class LN:
    def __init__(self : LN, value : object, next : LN = None):
        self.value = value
        self.next  = next

Basically the class allows us to create objects with two instance names: value
refers to some object (of any class) but next should either refer to an object
constructed from the LN class or refer to th special value None (its default
value above). In this way we describe LN as a self-referential class: each of
its objects refers to another one of its objects (although None will serve to
stop this recursive definition from being infinite: it will be the base case in
our recursive functions that process linked lists): None represents a linked
list with no/0 nodes. Generally, a linked list is a sequential list of values.

Actually, because when defining LN we cannot use LN for an annotation, the above
class at best can be written

class LN:
    def __init__(self, value : object, next = None):
        self.value = value
        self.next  = next

So a linked list is like a standard Python list (implemented by arrays, which
you'll learn tons about in ICS-45J/ICS-45C and ICS-46, but are hidden in
Python). Here, and much more in these other courses, we will learn many details
concerning the objects that implement linked lists and how we can implement,
using linked lists, the kinds of operations we perform on standard Python lists.
In ICS-46 we will focus the the performance tradesoff (speed/space) for array
vs. linked structures for representing lists.

We already know a lot about names refering to objects that have namespaces,
but objects refering to objects (of the same class) that refer to objects (of
the same class) that refer to objects (of the same class) ... will be something
new to learn about and explore.

We will start with pictures, because pictures are essential to understanding
and manipulating these data structures. In lecture, I will show some detailed
diagrams of linked lists built with LN objects; then I will remove much
redundant information to show more concise and easy to draw pictures. Please
copy these down, as they are not in the notes.

     Show detailed pictures here in lecture

Here is an abbreviated picture: name x refers to an LN object whose value is 5
and whose next is a reference to another LN object whose value 3 and whose next
is a reference to another LN object whose value 8 and whose next is .....
The value None is represented symbolically by the symbol /.

  x
+---+    +---+---+    +---+---+    +---+---+    +---+---+    +---+---+
| --+--->| 5 | --+--->| 3 | --+--->| 8 | --+--->| 2 | --+--->| 4 | / |
+---+    +---+---+    +---+---+    +---+---+    +---+---+    +---+---+

Note that the tails of the arrows (references) are put INSIDE a box
representing a place where a name's value is stored. The heads of the arrows
refer to an entire LN object, not any particular instance name/value in it.

In the following, whenever we see a .name it means "follow the arrrow to the
object it refers to (all arrows refer to objects) and access the name attribute.
Read the following carefully; everything later we do with linked lists is built
on understanding the meaning of .name (something you've been doing with class
objects for a while, even if just doing something like alist.append(...). So
  (1) x stores a reference to the first LN object
  (2) x.value stores a reference to the int object 5
  (3) x.next stores a reference to the second LN object
  (4) x.next.value stores a reference to the int object 3 in this second LN
        object
  (5) x.next.next stores a reference to the third LN object
  (4) x.next.next.value stores a reference to the int object 8 in this third
         LN object

Don't memorize this; understand what .name means and carefully be able to
analyze each of these expressions, and any others using .next and .value.

Typically we will look at classes for a list/tree data structure as representing
just data and no methods. So, we will examine functions defined outside of LN,
not methods defined inside the LN class (although most of these functions can be
easily written as methods). We will discuss both iterative and recursive
versions of most functions.

See the download that contains all these functions and a simple driver that you
can use to test them.

<div class="top"><h4><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></h4></div>

<a name="functions"><h1>Functions that query/access Linked Lists</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
One of the main operations we perform on linked lists (as we do with lists)
is to iterate over them, processing all their values. The following function
computes the sum of all the values in a linked list ll.

def sum_ll(ll):
    sum = 0
    sum ll != None:
        sum += ll.value
        ll = ll.next
    return sum

Lots of code that traverses (iterates over) linked lists looks similar. In class
we will go over (hand simulate) how this code processes the linked list above,
with the call sum_ll(x) and see exactly how it is that we visit each node in
the linked list and stop processing it at the end.

There is no special iterator for LN objects (unless we create one, as we will
below); LN is just like any other Python class.

We can also define linked lists recursively and use such a definition to help
us write functions that recursively process linked lists. 

  (1) None is the smallest linked list: it contains no nodes
  (2) A list node whose next refers to a linked list is also linked list

So None is a linked list (of 0 values); a list node whose next is None is a
linked list (of 1 value); a list node whose next is a list node whose next is
None is a linked list (of 2 values); etc.

So, we can recursively process a linked list by processing its first LN and then
recursively processing the (one smaller) linked list they refer to; recursion
ends at None (which is the base case: the smallest linked list). We can
recursively compute the sum of linked list by

def sum_ll_r(ll):
    if ll == None:
        return 0
    else:
        return ll.value + sum_ll_r(ll.next)

Back to the three rules we studied to prove a recursive functions correct:

(1) It recognizes and computes the correct result for the smallest (no LN)
      linked list: it returns 0 which is the sum of no nodes.

(2) Each recursive call is on a smaller linked list, which is closer to the
      base case: The recursive call is on ll.next, which is a linked list with
      one fewer nodes.

(3) Assuming sum_ll_r(ll.next) computes the sum of all values after the node
      representing the start of the linked list to be processed, this function
      returns the sum of all the nodes in this linked list: if we add the value
      of this first node to the sum of the values in all the following nodes in
      the linked list, then we have computed the sum of all the nodes in the
      linked list.

An even simpler traversal of linked lists computes their length. Here are the 
iterative and recursive methods.

def len_ll(ll):
    count = 0
    while ll != None:
        count += 1
        ll = ll.next
    return count

def len_ll_r(ll):
    if ll == None:
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 + len_ll_r(ll.next)
 
These are simpler than the sum_ll function: rather than adding the value of
each list node, these add 1 to a count for each list node, ultimately computing
the number of list nodes in the entire linked list: its length.

Next lets look at computing a string representation for a list. There is no
standard for how linked lists are represented as strings. We could convert them
to look like a normal list: [...] but instead we will use the following form
'5->3->8->2->4->None'. Here are the iterative and recursive functions to produce
such strings.

In the iterative method, for each node in the list we append its value followed
by '->' into a string, and append just the value 'None' at the end, before
returning.

def str_ll(ll):
    answer = ''
    while ll != None:
        answer += str(ll.value)+'->'
        ll = ll.next
    return answer + 'None'

In the recursive version, we return 'None' as the base-case, appending
the value and '->' in front of the result returned on each recursive call.

def str_ll_r(ll):
    if ll == None:
        return 'None'
    else:
        return str(ll.value)+'->'+str_ll_r(ll.next)

In all these examples, the iterative and recursive code have been approximately
the same complexity. Let's now look at two other functions: one that converts a
standard Python list into a linked list, and one that copies a linked list,
observing that the recursive versions are a bit simpler to write and understand.
BUT, you should hand simulate the iterative methods to understand how/why they
work too.

First: two functions to convert a standard Python list into a linked list.

In list_to_ll we must treat an empty list specially, returning None: otherwise
(for a non-empty list) we can access the first value: l[0]. We make two names
refer to its LN (which has next=None): front and rear. We will not change front
and eventually return its value (returning a reference to the front of all the
list nodes in our list). We add each new value at the end of the list of nodes
by extending the node rear refers to: changing its next from None to an actual
list node (whose next is None), and then re-adjusting rear to refer to this new
end-of-the-list node, extending it as many times as necessary.

def list_to_ll(l):
    if l == []:
        return None
    front = rear = LN(l[0])
    for v in l[1:]:
        rear.next = LN(v)
        rear = rear.next
    return front

The recursive version of this function is simpler, and looks pretty much like
all the recursive functions that we have seen for linked lists. One interesting
feature of note: the constructor for LN has the recursive call as its second 
argument.

def list_to_ll_r(l):
    if l == []:
        return None
    else:
        return LN(l[0], list_to_ll_r(l[1:]))

Here is the proof this function is correct

(1) It recognizes and computes the correct result for the smallest (empty) list:
    it returns None, which is an empty linked list.

(2) Each recursive call is on a smaller list, which is closer to the base case:
      The recursive call is on l[1:], the standard one-smaller list.

(3) Assuming list_to_ll(l[1:]) returns a linked list with all the values in the
      l[1:], this function returns a linked list of all the values in the
      parameter list: it returns a reference to a new list node with the first
      value in the list (l[0]) and whose .next refers to a linked list with
      all the values in l[1:].

To find a value in a linked list (returning a reference to the node that
contains that value, we write an iterative method and two recursive variants.
Each returns None if the value is not found in the linked list.

Iteratively, we use ll to traverse the list, looking for avalue: we either find
it or "run off the end of the list" and return None

def find_ll(ll, avalue):
    while ll != None:
        if ll.value == avalue:
            return ll
        ll = ll.next
    return None

We can also write this more simply as follows, combining the two conditions
for returning a value; when the loop terminates, the test

  ll != None and ll.value != avalue

is False, so either ll == None or ll.value == avalue; in both cases returning
ll is correct. Note that the short-circuit evaluation of the and operator (and
the order of the conjuncts) is critical: we should not follow the reference in
ll (with ll.value) until we are sure that ll does not refer to the None object;
if it does ll.value would raise an exception.

def find_ll(ll, avalue):
    while ll != None and ll.value != avalue:   # short-circuit and is critical
        ll = ll.next
    return ll

For the recursive functions, the first uses the simplest base case/non-base case
form. If the linked list isn't empty

def find_ll_r(ll, avalue):
    if ll == None:
        return None
    else:
        if ll.value == avalue:
            return ll
        else:
            return find_ll_r(ll.next,avalue)

We could replace this entire body by one complicated conditional expression:

return (None if ll==None else ll if ll.value==avalue else find_ll_r(ll.next,avalues)

But this version is very hard to read, and not in the standard recursive form
that we have been using.

As a slight variant (and similar to what we did in the while loop version) we
can test both ll == None or ll.value == avalue and in both cases return ll
(returning either None of a reference to a list node). Note that if ll == None
is True, short-circuit evaluation of "or" means that the expression
ll.value == avalue will not need to be evaluated: good thing, too, because
accessing ll.value when ll is None would raise an exception.

def find_ll_r2(ll, avalue):
    if ll == None or ll.value == avalue: # short-circuit or is critical
        return ll
    else:
        return find_ll_r(ll.next,avalue)

Note that this function is tail recursive and could autoamtically be written
iteratively (as the code above)

We have already examined code that returned the linked list equivalent of a
standard Python list. Here is similar code that copies a linked list:
constructs new nodes with the same values, arranged in the same order, in a
linked list. In the iterative version we again use front/rear to remember the
front of the list and extend the rear for each values we traverse in ll.

def copy_ll(ll): 
    if ll == None:
        return None
    front = rear = LN(ll.value)
    while ll.next != None:
        ll = ll.next
        rear.next = LN(ll.value)
        rear = rear.next
    return front

As we expect, the recursive version is more elegant, and similar to the other
recursive code that processes linked lists. It is similar to the code we wrote
to translate a Python list into a liked list.
 
def copy_ll_r(ll):
    if ll == None:
        return None
    else:
        return LN(ll.value,copy_ll_r(ll.next))

Finally, languages like Java/C++ don't easily support generators. But because
Python, does we can easily write a generator that produces all the values in a
linked list.

def iterator(ll):
    while ll != None:
        yield ll.value
        ll = ll.next

With this code we could print every value in a linked list by writing

  for v in iterator(ll):
      print(v)

In fact, we could put a variant of this code in the __iter__ method in the LN
class as follows:

  def __iter__(self):
    current = self
    while current != None:
        yield current.value
        current = current.next

With this method, we could write just

  for v in ll:
      print(v)

<a name="functions1"><h1>Functions that command/mutate linked lists</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
All the functions above queried/accessed/created but did not mutate linked
lists: no changes were made to .value or .next of an LN object.

If x refers to the first LN in a linked list, we can add a new value at the
front of the linked list by the simple code:

  x = LN(newvalue,x)

Now x refers to a new list node, whose value is newvalue, and whose next refers
to the LN that x used to refer to: all the nodes in the original linked list.
Draw a picture with x = None originally or x refering to the linked list above.

We can write the following iterative/recursive functions to append a value at
the end of the linked list. In both cases the list is mutated: the last list
node has its next changed to refer to a new list node containing the new value
(and whose .next is None). But, to handle the case where x is initially empty
(stores None), the iterative/recursive functions must return a reference to the
front of the list (maybe x itself, or if x stored None, a reference to a
one-node linked list storing newvalue). We call these functions like

  x = append_ll(x,newvalue)

and

  x = append_ll_r(x,newvalue)

As with list_to_ll and copy, the iterative version needs to remember the front
while using ll to traverse down the list, to find the last list node to extend.

def append_ll(ll,value):
    if ll == None:
        return LN(value)
    front = ll
    while ll.next != None:  # while ll does not refer to the last node...
        ll = ll.next        # terminates when ll.next == None
    ll.next = LN(value)     # (know at end: ll.next == None) append value at end
    return front            # return reference to original front of ll

The recurisive method is again simpler to write.

def append_ll_r(ll,value):
    if ll == None:
        return LN(value)
    else:
        ll.next = append_ll_r(ll.next,value)
        return ll

Here is the proof this function is correct

(1) It recognizes and computes the correct result for the smallest (empty)
      linked list: it returns a reference to a linked list with one node
     (storing value)

(2) Each recursive call is on a smaller linked list, which is closer to the
      base case of None: the recursive call is on ll.next.

(3) Assuming append_ll_r(ll.next,value) returns a reference to a linked list
      that is one longer than ll.next containing all its list nodes followed by
      value in the last list node, this function returns a linked list that is
      one longer than ll containing all its list nodes followed by value in the
      last list node (by storing in ll.next a reference to the extended linked
      list and returning the original reference to ll).

Here are two simple functions (not iterative or recursive) to mutate a list by
adding/removing a value after one referred to by their argument. Both functions
return None implicitly.

def add_after_ll(ll,value):
    # raises an exception if ll is None
    ll.next = LN(value,ll.next)

def remove_after_ll(ll):
    # raises exception of ll (no list) or ll.next (no value to remove) is None
    ll.next = ll.next.next

Note that to remove the first value in a linked list, we write

  x = x.next

<a name="problems"><h1>Problems</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
1) Define a recursive function that converts a linked list of values into a
standard Python list?

2) To really understand how low-level linked list code works, use the list
shown above execute the call.

x = magic(x)

It actually mutates the list in a complicated way and returns a reference to
one of its nodes. Hand simulate the results (calling the function to see the
result produced before trying to hand simulate it has zero educational value.
I don't care whether you know the answer; I care whether you can hand simulate
this code and code like it that you might write.

def magic(ll): 
    answer = None
    while ll != None:
        t_m      = ll
        ll       = ll.next
        t_m.next = answer
        answer   = t_m 
    return answer

3) Define a function named select with two arguments: a linked list (ll) and a
non-negative integer (n); it returns the value of the nth value in the list
or raises an exception if there are too few values in the list. Write this
function iteratively and recursively.

4) Define a function named append, with two linked list arguments; it returns
a reference to the first node in a new linked list (lots of new LN objects)
with all the values in the first followed by all the values in the second. This
method does not mutate the arguments lists. Write this function iteratively and
recursively.

5) Define a function named append, with two linked list arguments; it returns
a reference to the first node in a linked list (no new LN objects) that contains
all the values in the first followed by all the values in the second.  This
method mutates the arguments lists. Write this function iteratively and
recursively.

6) Define a function named interleave, with two linked list arguments; it
returns a reference to the first node in a new linked list (lots of new LN
objects) with all the values in the first interleaved with all the values in
the second. This method does not mutate the arguments lists. Write this function
recursively

7) Define a function named interleave, with two linked list arguments; it
returns a reference to the first node in a linked list (no new LN objects) that
contains all the values in the first interleaved with all the values in the
second.  This method mutates the arguments lists. Write this function
recursively

8) Define a function named reverse, with one linked list argument; it returns
a reference to the first node in a new linked (lots of new LN objects) with all
the values in their reverse order. Write this function iteratively and
recursively.

9) Define a function named reverse, with one linked list argument; it returns
a reference to the first node in a linked (no new LN objects) with all the
values in their reverse order. This method mutates the arguments lists. Write
this iteratively and recursively

10) For the recursive functions written in 8 and 9, rewrite them to use a helper
method with an extra value that accumulates the reversed linked list. Such
functions will be tail recursive; translate their code to iterative functions.

11) Define a function named is_ordered, with one linked list argument; it
returns whether or not the list values are in non-decreasing order (each one
must be <= its successor).

12) Define a function named insert_ordered, with two argumets: one an ordered
linked list (see problem 11) and one value; it returns a reference to a linked
list with all the original values and the new one added so the linked list is
still ordered.

13) Define the __iter__ method in LN such that we can iterate over the values
in a linked list. Hint: either return  a nested classe implementing __next__
or return a generator (simpler) to do the job.
