<a name="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Functional programming is a style of programming that uses the simplicity and
power of functions to accomplish programming tasks. Some talk about the
functional programming paradigm. They contrast it with the more standard
imperative paradigm (which includes both the procedural and object-oriented
styles). Functional programs fundamentally evaluate expressions to
compute results; imperative programs fundamentally execute statements to compute
results (which often mutate data structures and rebind the values of names
-which pure functional programming prohibits).

In a purely functional solution to a problem, there will be no mutation to data
structures (instead of mutating one, a new one is built/returned, with the
required changes: just as we have seen with strings, which are immutable), and
recursion (not looping) is the primary control structure. Functions are called
"referentially transparent": given the same inputs, they always produce the same
result; we can always replace a function call with its ultimately returned
result. Whether or not a computation occurs doesn't affect later computations
(it has no side-effects, just a returned result).

A certain class of functions, called tail-recursive (we will illustrate them
in more detail below), can be automatically translated into non-recursive
functions that run a bit faster and do not use extra space: each recursive
function call occupies space for its parameters; most purely functional
languages implement tail-recursive functions by doing this translation; Python
does not (at least not yet).

Functional languages easily support and frequently use the passing of functions
as arguments to other functions (these other functions are called "higher-order"
functions or functionals) and functions being returned from other functions as
their values; we have seen both of these features used in Python, which does
support these features well, and we will see more uses of these features in this
lecture.

There are programming languages that are purely function (Haskell), others that
are mostly functional (ML -whose major implementations are SML and OCaml- the
Scheme dialect of Lisp, and Erlang), and still others that at least support a
functional style of programming (some better, some worse) when it is useful.
Python is in this latter category, although features like comprehensions in
in Python emphasize its functional programming aspects (generators and even
lambdas fall into this category too).

Generally, functional programming is characterized as using immutable objects
and no state changes (we can bind names once, but not rebind them). Strings,
tuples and frozensets are all immutable objects in Python (which means we can
use their values as keys in dicts and values in sets), but lists, sets, and
dicts are mutable (and therefore cannot be used these ways in sets and dicts).

In functional programming, we don't change data structures but produce new ones
that are variants of the old ones. For example, if we want to "change" the first
value (at index 0) of a tuple t to 1, we instead create a new tuple whose first
values is 1 and whose other values are all the other values in the tuple, using
the concatenation operator. The new tuple is specified as (1,)+t[1:]; note that
we need the comma in (1,) to distinguish it from (1): the former is a tuple
containing the value 1, the later is just an int.

Functional programming creates lots of objects and must do so in a time and
space efficient way, and for the most part, functional languages achieve parity
in time/space efficiency with imperative programming languages (functional
programs can be a bit slower, but they are often clearer/simpler/easier to both
understand and modify). Mixed paradigm languages like Python tend not to do as
well when used functionally as true functional languages. Emerging
multi-paradigm languages like Scala and Clojure are closing the gap. Also,
because of the simplicity of the semantics of functional programming, it is
easier to automatically transform functional programs to run more efficiently
in parallel, on cluster or multi-core computers.

Most functional programming languages are also statically type-safe. Before
programs are executed they are compiled (type-checked). If they type-check
correctly, the system executing them can be guaranteed that all operators and
functions will be applied to the correct number and type of arguments; if not
the compiler will report where errors like these are detected -the same errors
that Python would find, but before any code runs. Contrast this with Python,
which often discovers inappropriate argument types while running programs (at
runtime), not before running them. Of course there can still be other kinds of
errors (not type-related) in functional programs.

Functional programming languages are still not as widely used as imperative
languages, but they continue to find many uses in industry, and in some
industries (telecommunications) they have achieved dominance (at least with
some companies within the industries). Programmers who are trained to use
functional languages think about problems and solve problems differently. All
CS students should be exposed to functional programming as part of their
education (and I mean an exposure longer than one day, or even a few weeks).

To learn more about Python's use of functional programming, read section 10
(Functional Programming Modules) in Python's Library documentation, discussing
the itertools, functools, and the operator modules. Some of this material is
discussed in more detail below.

<a name="map"><h1>Map/Transform, Filter, Reduce/Accumulate</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We start this lecture by looking at just three important higher-order functions
used in functional programming: map (aka transform), filter, and reduce (aka
accumulate). Each operates on a function and an iterable, which means they
operate on lists and tuples easily, but also on iterables that don't store all
their values and just produce values as necessary (e.g., the ints and primes
generators). We will write recursive and generator versions of each, with the
recursive versions having list parameters and returning lists, because many
functional programing languages use only lists, not tuples, but of course lists
are immutable in these languages: the base case for both lists and tuple is
len(x) == 0: instead of x = []  or x = ().

(1) map/transform: this function takes a unary function and some list/iterable
    of values and produces a list/iterable of mapped/transformed values based on
    substituting each value with the result of calling the parameter function
    on that value. For example, calling

   map_l(lambda x : x**2, [i for i in irange(0,5)])

produces a list of the squares of the values of the numbers 0 to 5:
[0,1,4,9,16,25]. Calling

   map_i(lambda x : x**2, irange(0,5))

produces an iterable of the squares of the values of the numbers 0 to 5: the
value produced is a generator that we can iterate over. If we wrote
list(map_i(lambda x : x**2, irange(0,5))) Python would return the same result
as for map_l because it would construct a list by iterating over the iterable.

Note that lambdas are frequently (but not exclusively) used in calls to the map
function: often we need to use a small, simple function once, which we can most
easily write as a lambda.

Here are simple implementations of the list/iterator versions of this map. For
map_l we define a recursive verion; map_i is a generator

def map_l(f,alist):
    if alist == []:
        return []
    else:
        return [f(alist[0])] + map_l(f,alist[1:])

In languages that do not have comprehensions, this is the standard definition.
In Python, which has comprehensions, we could also write it as

def map_l(f,alist):
    return [f(i) for i in alist]

Here is the map_i function, which is a genrator.
    
def map_i(f,iterable):
    for i in iterable:
        yield f(i)

Note that Python defines its map to be a generator (so it is closer to map_i
than map_l):

 y = map(lambda x : x**2, irange(0,5))
 print(y)

prints

 < map object at 0x02C42BF0>

This result is similar to printing a call to a generator.

Again, we can use a list/tuple/set constructor to turn such a map object into an
actual list/tuple/set: it iterates through the values produced by map and
collects these values in a list/tuple/set.

 print(list(y))

prints

  [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

In fact, the real map defined in Python is generalized to work on any number of
lists/iterables. If there are n iterables, then the function f must have n
parameters. So, if we called the real map function in Python (which as we've
seen, produces an iterable) as

 print(   list( map(lambda x,y: x*y, 'abcde', irange(1,5)) )   )

prints

  ['a', 'bb', 'ccc', 'dddd', 'eeeee']

How does Python define map for these arbitrary number of arguments? It uses zip,
which is actually a generator (returning something that is iterable). So we can
define Python's map function as a version of map_i generalized to arguments
with multiple iterables.

def map(f,*iterables):
    for args in zip(*iterables):
        yield f(*args)

again, print( map(lambda x,y: x*y, 'abcde', irange(1,5)) )

prints like < map object at 0x02C36EF0>.


(2) filter: this function takes a predicate (a unary function returning a bool,
although in Python most values have a bool interpretation: recall the __bool__
method) and some list/iterable of values and produces a list/iterable with only
those values for which the predicate returns True (or a value that is
interpreted as True). For example, calling

   filter_l(predicate.is_prime, [i for i in irange(2,50)])

produces a list of the values between 2 and 50 inclusive that are prime:
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47].

Here are simple implementations of the list/iterator versions of this function.
Again for filter_l we define a recursive verion; filter_i is a generator.

def filter_l(p,alist):
    if alist == []:
        return []
    else:
        if p(alist[0]):
            return [alist[0]] + filter_l(p,alist[1:])
        else:
            return filter_l(p,alist[1:])

which we can simplify a bit, by using a conditional expression and noting that
[] + alist = alist

def filter_l(p,alist):
    if alist == []:
        return []
    else:
        return ([alist[0]] if p(alist[0]) else [])   +   filter_l(p,alist[1:])

In languages that do not have comprehensions, this is the standard definition.
In Python, which has comprehensions, we could also write it as

def filter_l(p,alist):
    return [i for i in alist if p(i)]

Here is the filter_i function, which is a genrator.

def filter_i(p,iterable):
    for i in iterable:
        if p(i):
            yield i

Note that Python defines its filter like filter_i: it produces a generator when
called.

y = filter(predicate.is_prime, irange(2,50))
print(y)

prints like < filter object at 0x02C42BF0>.


Again, we can use a list/tuple/set constructor to turn such a map object into an
actual list/tuple/set: it iterates through the values produced by filter and

print(list(y))

prints

  [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]


(3) reduce/accumulate: this function is different than the previous two: it
takes a binary function and some list/iterable of values and typically produces
a single value: it reduces or accumulates its arguments into a single value. 

Unlike map and filter (which are defined and automatically imported from the
builtins module) we must import reduce from the functools module explicitly.

For example, calling

  reduce(lambda x,y : x+y, irange(1,100)])

returns the sum of all the values in the irange iterable. Here is a more
interesting call, because uses a non-commutative operator (subtraction).

  reduce(lambda x,y : x-y, [1,2,3])

which returns -4: or 1 - 2 - 3 or (1-2)-3. Technically, this is called LEFT
reduction/accumulation because the operators are applied left to right. If
they had been applied right to left (right reduction), the result would have
been 1-(2-3) = 1 - (-1) = 2. For all commutative operators, the association
order doesn't make a difference. That is, (1+2)+3 is the same as 1+(2+3). So
for 5 values, the reduce is equivalent to (((1+2)+3)+4)+5.

Note that the operator module defines a variety of functions like add (which
has the same meaning as lambda x,y: x+y) so we could also call this function
as reduce(operator.add, irange(1,100)) if we had imported operator. Other
standard operators appear in this module as well.

It also includes the operator.itemgetter, which is a function that takes any
number of arguments and returns a function that can be called on any object
implementing __getitem__: for example, operator.itemgetter(n) returns a function
that can select the nth item in a list: operator.itemgetter(1)([1,2,3]) returns
2, like [1,2,3][1] or [1,2,3].__getitem__(1). Likewise,
operator.itemgetter(0,2) returns a function that can selects the 1st and 3rd
item in a list: operator.itemgetter(0,2)([1,2,3]) returns (1,3); note that it
returns a tuple.

The function attrgetter does the same thing with attributes:
operator.attrgetter(attr)(object) returns the same value as either
eval('object.'+attr) or object.__dict__[attr]. If c is a class with attributes
a and b, then calling operator.attrgettr('a','b')(c) returns a tuple equivalent
to (c.a, c.b).

Here is another interesting example. Assume that we define the max function to
return the bigger of its two values.

def max(x,y):
    return x if x > y else y

Then, calling

  reduce(max, [4,2,-3,8,6])

is equivalent to max(max(max(max(4,2),-3),8),6) which evaluates (left to right)
as follows, to compute the maximum of the entire list of values.

max(max(max(max(4,2),-3),8),6) -> max(max(max(4,-3),8),6) ->
max(max(4,8),6) -> max(8,6) -> 8

Here is a simplified definition of reduce that illustrates its typical behavior
on good arguments: it assumes that iterable has at least one value (which it
returns, if there are no more values in the iterable).

def reduce(f,iterable):
    i = iter(iterable)		  # create iterator
    a = next(i)			  # get first value
    while True:			  # while (to process more values in iterator)
        try:			  #   try (to determine if more values)
            a = f(a,next(i))	  #     get next/f combines with previous result
        except StopIteration:	  #   when no more values in iterator
            return a		  #     return reduced/accumulated result

it is also possible to write this function as follows, since the init(i) called
in the for loop returns i.

def reduce(f,iterable):
    i = iter(iterable)		  # create iterator
    a = next(i)			  # get first value
    for j in i:			  # iterate over all remaining valuse in i
        a = f(a,j)	          #   using j/f combines with previous result
    return a			  # return reduced/accumulated result


Hand simulate calls to reduce(max,[1]), reduce(max,[2,1]), reduce(max,[1,2]), 
etc. to ensure you understand how this code works for 1/2-list, how the loop
eventually stops, and how the function computes the correct value. Note that
this function raises a StopIteration exception if the iterable is empty: the
first call to next(i) will raise a StopException which is not handled (because
it is not in the nested try/except). This is not how Python' reduce works...

The actual implementation of reduce allows the programmer to specify what value
to return for an empty iterable, and is a bit more complicated: e.g., it
requires two nested try/except statements. It allows either 2 or 3 arguments:
the first must be a binary function (which we will still call f), the second
must be an iterable (which we will still call iterable), and the third (if
present) is called the unit (aka initializer).

If the iterable has no values, the unit is returned if it is supplied,
otherwise map raises a special TypeError (not StopIteration) exception. Also,
if the unit is specified, it is considered to be the implicit first value in
the iterable. All these semantics are captured in the following function, which
has the core of the previous reduce, but allows for this new behavior based on
the optional third argument.

def reduce(f,*args):
    if not (1 <= len(args) <= 2): # decode the arguments
        if len(args) < 1:
            raise TypeError('reduce expected at least 2 arguments, got '+str(len(args)))
        else:
            raise TypeError('reduce expected at most 3 arguments, got '+str(len(args)))

    iterable = args[0]

    i = iter(iterable)            # create iterator
    try:                          # try (to handle empty iterator)
        a = args[1] if len(args) == 2 else next(i)
                                  # use unit or get first value
        while True:               # while (to process more values in iterator)
            try:                  #   try (to determine if more values)
                a = f(a,next(i))  #     get next/f combines with previous result
            except StopIteration: #   when no more values in iterator
                return a          #     return reduced/accumulated result
    except StopIteration:         # empty iterator: return unit/raise exception
        raise TypeError('reduce() of empty sequence with no initial value') from None
        
Note that
  reduce(operator.add,[])    raises a TypeError Exception
  reduce(operator.add,[] ,0) returns  0 (the unit)
  reduce(operator.add,[5])   returns  5
  reduce(operator.add,[5],0) returns  5 (the unit, 0,  + the first value)
  reduce(operator.add,[5],5) returns 10 (the unit,5, + the first value)

There is only one verion of this function, because it produces a single answer,
so we don't need separate list/iterable versions. There is a simple recursive
definition of the reduce function operating on list (here shown with a mandated
unit to keep this function simple), but it uses RIGHT reduction/accumulation,
which as we saw for commutative operators produces the same result. 

def right_reduce_l(f,alist,unit):
    if alist = []:
        return unit
    else:
        return f( alist[0], reduce(f,alist[1:],unit) )

Here is a concrete example of a function style of programming, using map,
filter, and reduce. This expression computes the length of the longest line in
a file. 

reduce(max, map(lambda l : len(l.rstrip()), open('file')))

So, we use open('file') as the iterable to map, which maps each line to its
length; the result of this call is used as the iterable to reduce, which reduces
all these line lengths to the single maximum length.

To return the longest line, not the length of the longest line, we could alter
the computation slightly, as follows.

reduce(lambda x,y: x if len(x) >= len(y) else y,
         map(lambda l : l.rstrip(), open('file')))

Here we still use open('file) as the iterable to map, but the lambda to map now
just strips spaces off the right end, but doesn't map lines to their lengths.
The lambda for reduce (whose arguments will be two lines from the file) returns
the longer of the two lines by computing and comparing the len of each; when
reduced over all lines in the file, the final result is the longest line in the
file. If multiple lines are longest, the one appearling earliest will be the
result (because of >=).

Often the form of such a function combines all aspects; one example is:

   reduce(r_lambda, map(m_lambda, filter(f_lambda, iterable)))

which reduces all the mapped values that make it through filter. The idiom of
mapping the result of a filter is already captured in Python's comprehension:

(m_lambda(i) for i in iterable if f_lambda(i))

Functional programmers spend a lot of time using these tools to build up their
idioms of expressions. We are just peeking at this topic now. For example, it
is possible for reduce to return all type of results, not just simple ones:
there are for example, ways to reduce lists of lists to produce just lists.

<a name="struct"><h1>Structural Recursion, Accumulation, and Tail Recursion</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
So far, in all the recursive methods that we have written, the form of recursion
is based on the data structure the function is processing. Typically we recur
on a substructure (same type of structure but smaller in size) until we reach
its base case: the smallest size of that data structure. This is called
structural recursion (a more general form is called generative recursion, but
we will not discuss it). A typical example of structural recursion is the
list_sum function below.

def list_sum (l : [int]) -> int:
    if l == []:
        return 0
    else:
        return l[0] + list_sum(l[1:])

A directly recursive function is tail-recursive if the the result the function
returns by a recursive call is exactly the value computed by the recursive call,
not modified in any way. Notice that the list_sum function is NOT tail-recursive
becauses it returns l[0] plus the result of the recursive call, not just the
recursive call.

We can sometimes transform structually recursive functions into tail-recursive
functions by using an accumulator: an extra parameter that accumulates the
answer in each recursive call: typically the function returns this accumulator
in the base case, and the function is tail-recursive because it returns just the
result of a recursive call (but with the accumulator updated). Often we define
the function by defining and calling a nested function, which has an extra
accumulation parameter.

Here is how we can transform the function above into a function using an
accumulator, which results in a tail-recursive function.

def list_sum ( l : [int]) -> int:
    def sum_tail(al,acc)
        if al == []:
            return acc
        else:
            return sum_tail(al[1:],al[0]+acc)
    return sum_tail(l,0)

The result of calling the single parameter list_sum(l) function is computed by
returning the result of calling the two parameter sum_tail(l,0) function. The
sum_tail function returns the value accumulated in acc when its list parameter
is empty; otherwise is performs structural recursion while increasing acc by
the amount of the first value in the list (which is not processed in the
recursive call). Notice that in the call sum_tail(l,0) the 0 is like the unit
in the reduce function: it is the starting point for adding/accumulating
values.

We can transform a tail-recursive function into an iterative one by using a
while loop whose test is the opposite of the one for the base case, and whose
body updates the parameter names in the same way that they would be updated by
performing the recursive function call (binding parameters to arguments); after
the body of the loop is a return statement returning the value in acc, the
accumulator. We can transform sum_tail as follows.

def list_sum (l : [int]) -> int:
    def sum_tail(al,acc):
        while al != []:
            al, acc = al[1:], al[0] + acc # mirrors the recursive call
        return acc
    return sum_tail(l,0)

In fact, we can simplify the code for list_sum by replacing the call to the
nested function by executing its body prefaced by the initial assignment to its
parameters. We can transform list_sum as follows

def list_sum (l : [int]) -> int:
    al,acc = l,0	                  # mirrors the initial call
    while al != []:
        al,acc = al[1:], al[0] + acc      # mirrors the recursive call
    return acc

All tail-recursive functions can be transformed similarly, running more
efficiently (in time and space) than their equivalent recursive functions.

<a name="part"><h1>Partial function evaluation</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The functools module in Python includes a function named partial that allows us
to decorate a function by pre-supplying specified arguments (both positional
and keyword); it returns a function that we can call more easily, with fewer
arguments: it combines both the actual arguments and the pre-supplied ones to
call the function. This kind of decoration is called a partially evaluating a
function.

First let's look at how we can use such a tool and then we will learn how it is
written in Python's functools module. We start by defining a simple function
that we will partially evaluate, which has two parameters: level and message. It
just prints the values of these parameters in a special format.

def log(purpose, message):
    print('[{p}]: {m}'.format(p=purpose, m=message) )

Now we will show how to partially evaluate this function using the first and
then the second argument.

----------
Partially evaluating with the 1st argument

Suppose that we want a function named debug to act like log, but have only one
argument (message); the argument matching purpose will always be 'debug'. That
is, the debug function logs messages whose purpose is always for debugging. We
can specify debug as follows, supplying the argument 'debug' to the purpose
parameter positionally.

from functools import partial
x = 1
debug = partial(log, 'debug')  #'debug' is 1st positional argument

Now, calling debug calls the log function always supplying 'debug' as the first
positional argument. So, we can call debug with one argument, like

debug('Beginning function f')  #call log with 'debug' as 1st positional argument
debug(message = 'x = '+str(x)) #call log with 'debug' as 1st positional argument

which prints

  [debug]: Beginning function f
  [debug]: x = 1

Here, calling debug('some message') is like calling log('debug','some message').

We can also use partial to specify debug as follows, writing purpose = 'debug',
which specifies a keyword argument.

debug = partial(log, purpose = 'debug')  #'debug' is a keyword argument

Now, we can call debug with one argument, but it must be supplied as a keyword
argument.

debug(message = 'Beginning function f') #call log with 'debug' matching purpose
debug(message = 'x = '+str(x))          #call log with 'debug' matching purpose

which prints the same as above

  [debug]: Beginning function f
  [debug]: x = 1

Calling debug(message='some message') is like calling
log(purpose='debug',message='some message'). Notice that in this case if we
called debug with the message positionally, as debug('some message') it would
be like calling log('some message',purpose='debug'), which Python would report
by raising the TypeError exception, because the first positional argument would
match the purpose parameter, and the keyword argument matches the same parameter
name. Python would report

 TypeError: log() got multiple values for argument 'purpose'

----------
Partially evaluating with the 2nd argument

Now suppose that we want a function named notify to act like log, but have only
one argument (purpose) with the argument matching message always being 'Notify'.
That is, the notify function logs messages that are the same. We can specify
notify as follows, supplying the argument 'Notify' to the message as a keyword
parameter only.

from functools import partial
x = 1
notify = partial(log, message='Notify') #'Notify' is a keyword argument

Now, notify calls the log function always supplying 'Notify' as the first
argument. So, we can call notify with one argument, like

notify('debug')                        # call log with 'Notify' matching message
notify(purpose = 'log')                # call log with 'Notify' matching message

which prints

  [debug]: Notify
  [log]: Notify

Calling notify('some purpose') is like calling
log('some purpose',message='Notify') and calling notify(purpose='some purpose')
is like calling log(purpose='some purpose',message='Notify').

We CANNOT do this kind of partial evaluation using partial(log, 'Notify')
because positionally purpose is the first parameter to log, not message. So
that is why there is a difference in partially evaluating the first vs. second
parameter to a function.

----------
Two more examples:

Let's illustrate a few more interesting uses of partial evaluation before
showing the Python code that defines this function. It isn't hard to define
these two functions conventionally, but it is simple to use the partial
function.

(1) Suppose that we wanted a function that returns the index of character in a
string of vowels (and -1 if it is not a vowel). We could write.

from functools import partial
index_of = partial(str.index,'aeiou')

Calling index_of('i') would return 2; calling index_of('z') would return -1.

In fact, we can write

from functools import partial
index_of = partial('aeiou'.index)

and get the same results, because Python actually translates 'aeiou'.index into
partial(str.index,'aeiou') by the Fundamental Equation of Object-Oriented
Programming: using partial to specify the self parameter.

Finally, we could also just use a lambda and write
index_of = lambda to_check : 'aeiou'.index(to_check)

(2) Suppose that we wanted a function that returns whether or not all characters
in a text string argument matches the pre-specified description of an integer
with an optional sign. We could write.

from functools import partial
import re
is_int = partial(re.match,'[+-]?\d+$')

then calling is_int('+33') would match but is_int('33+') would not match.

If we wanted to reverse this, and instead write a function that returns whether
or not its regular expression argument matches all the characters in a
pre-specified text string. We could write

from functools import partial
import re
is_match = partial(re.match,string="+33")

Because string is the second parameter, we must specify it as named. Then,
calling is_match('[+-]?\d+$') would match (returns a match object) but
is_match('\d+$') would not (returns None).

All these simple examples use partial evaluation on functions that have just a
few arguments. For functions with very many arguments, the usefulness of partial
is increased. Here is one more example that uses partial to partially evaluate
the print function, which has a few named parameters. Here p_sec is print with
sep and end both pre-specified as empty strings.

p_seq = partial(print, sep='', end='')

calling

p_seq(1,2,3)
p_seq(4,5,6)

prints: 123456

again, we could define
p_seq = lambda *args : print(*args,sep='',end='')

----------

Defining partial as a Python function

Finally, let's look at how we can simply define (although the code is a bit
subtle) the partial function in Python. Here is its defintion and explanation
of how it works.

def partial(func, *args, **kargs):              # bind pre-specified arguments
    def p_func(*pargs, **pkargs):               # bind the arguments in call
        p_kargs = kargs.copy()			# copy kargs dict (from partial)
        p_kargs.update(pkargs)			# update it: add pkargs dict
        return func(*(args + pargs), **p_kargs) # call the original function
    return p_func	     	     		# return a reference to p_func

Fundamentally, partial takes arbitrary positional (*args) and keyword (**kargs)
arguments; it defines a local function and returns a reference to it. When the
local function is called (after partial returns it) it takes the positional
arguments (*pargs) it is passed and appends them after the *args passed to
partial; it takes the keyword arguments (**pkargs) it is passed and uses them
to update the copy of a keyword dictionary that is a copy of the **kargs one
originally passed to partial. When it calls func, it takes the appended tupled
(*args + *pargs) and expands it to positional arguments and the updated p_kargs
dictionary and expands it to keyword arguments.

In fact, the actually definition of partial in Python is more like the
following.

def partial(func, *args, **kargs):              # bind pre-specified arguments
    def p_func(*pargs, **pkargs):               # bind the arguments in call
        p_kargs = kargs.copy()			# copy kargs dict (from partial)
        p_kargs.update(pkargs)			# update it: add pkargs dict
        return func(*(args + pargs), **p_kargs) # call the original function
    p_func.func      = func			# Remember (in a queryable form)
    p_func.args      = args			#   all arguments to partial:
    p_func.keywords  = kargs			#   func, args, and kargs
    return p_func     				# return a reference to p_func

In this version we add three attribute names to the p_func function object that
is returned, recording useful information for it, which we can query. Function
objects, like all other object, can have attibutes. So if we wrote

debug = partial(log, "debug")
print(debug.func, debug.args, debug.keywords)

Python would print: <function log at 0x02CCA780> ('debug',) {}

Showing the actual function being called, and what positional and keyword
arguments are automatically going to be suppplied.

In a simpler context, we can define

def f(x):
    return f.mult * x

and then we can later set f.mult = 2, so calling f(3) returns 6. So function
objects have name spaces that we can manipulate as well.

<a name="reduce"><h1>MapReduce, commutative functions, and parallel processing</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
MapReduce is a special implemention of the map/reduce functions implemented to
run in parallel on cluster, or multi-core computers. If we can write our code
within the MapReduce language, we can guarantee that it runs quickly on the
kinds of computers Google uses for its servers. Generally what it does is run 
similar operations on huge amounts of data (the map part), combining results
(the reduce part), until we get a single answer. Apache Hadoop is open source
version of MapReduce (but to really see its power, we need a cluster of
computer to run our code on).

How does MapReduce work? The story is long, but here is a quick overview.
Imagine we have a commutative operator and want to compute: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n

We can evaluate this expression as shown above, which would require n-1
additions one right after the other (the former must finish before the later
starts). Even if we had multiples cores, doing the operations in this order
would require n-1 sequential additions because only one core at a time would be
active.

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16
|   |   |   |
+-+-+   |   |
  |     |   |
  3     |   |
  |     |   |
  +--+--+   |
     |      |
     6      |
     |      |
     +------+
         |
        10
         .... note that one more operand is used at each level

Here each level uses 1 core and there are 15 levels. In general, with N numbers
to add it take N-1 time steps/levels.

Now, how MapReduce can handle this problem?

Instead, because of commutivity, we can evaluate this expression in a
different way: add the 1st and 2nd values at the same time as we add the 3rd
and 4th at the same time as the 5th and 6th ... In all, we can add n/2 pairs
simultaneously (if we had n/2 cores). We can use this same trick for the
remaining n/2 sums, simultaneously adding them together; then for the n/4 sums,
..., to the final sum sums (for which only one processor is necessary). Here is
a pictorial representation of this process for 16 values.

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16

             36                                 100

                              136

Here each level uses as many cores as possible there are 4 levels. In general,
with N numbers to add it takes Log2 N times steps. Recall that Log2 1,000 is
10, Log2 1,000,000 is 20, and Log2 1,000,000,000 = 30. But, to perform 10**9
additions in 30 time steps,  we'd need a half billion cores: not likely this is
coming in your lifetime. But if we had tens-or-hundreds of cores, we could keep
them all busy except for the last few (bottom) levels. So we could get our code
to run tens-or-hundreds of times faster. Of course, the unneeded cores can
start working on the next MapReduce problem.

<a name="comb"><h1>Combinatorial Computing</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
This lecture got too long for this section to be detailed, which mostly was
going to be about various iterators in the itertools module. Instead, I have
listed just the combinatoric generators there. Here is just a quick overview of
some intuitive and useful ones. The itertools module covers other interesting
iterator decorators to peform a wide range of operations.

product(*iterables)

  produces tuples with the cartesian product of the iterators, where each
  represents one "dimension). For example list(product('ab',irange(1,3)))
  produces the following list of 2-tuples

  [('a', 1), ('a', 2), ('a', 3), ('b', 1), ('b', 2), ('b', 3)]


permutations(iterable,r=None)

  produces tuples (in sorted order) that are permutations of the values
  produced from iterable. If r is specified, each result is an r-tuple
  (if not, each tuple has all the values in the iterable). For example
  list(permutations('abc')) produces the following list of 3-tuples of 'abc'

  [('a','b','c'),('a','c','b'),('b','a','c'),('b','c','a'),('c','a','b'),('c','b','a')]

  list(permutations('abc',2)) produces the following list of 2-tuples of 'abc'

  [('a','b'),('a','c'),('b', 'a'),('b','c'),('c','a'),('c', 'b')]

  Generally, if iterable has n values, the number of tuples returned is
  n!/(n-r!) when 0<=r<=n and 0 when r > n.

combinations(iterable,r)

  produces r-tuples (in sorted order) that are combinations of the unique values
  produced the from iterable (where only the values, not their order, is
  important). For example, list(combinations('abcd',3)) produces the following
  list of 3-tuples of 'abcd'

  [('a', 'b', 'c'), ('a', 'b', 'd'), ('a', 'c', 'd'), ('b', 'c', 'd')]

  Generally, if iterable has n values, the number of tuples returned is
  n!/r!(n-r!) when 0<=r<=n and 0 when r > n.


combinations_with_replacement(iterable,r)

  produces r-tuples (in sorted order) that are combinations of the values
  (which don't have to be unique) produced the from iterable (where only the
  values, not their order, is important). For example,
  list(combinations_with_replacement('abc'),2) produces the following
  list of 2-tuples of 'abc'

  [('a','a'), ('a','b'), ('a','c'), ('b', 'b'), ('b','c'), ('c','c')]

  Generally, if iterable has n values, the number of tuples returned is
  (n+r-1)!/r!(n-r!) when n > 0

<div class="top"><h4><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></h4></div>

<a name="problems"><h1>Problems</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
1) Define a function using map, filter, and reduce, to compute the number of
times a certain string appears in a file (reading a line at a time)? Define
another function that does the same, but does not count any occurences after a
'#' on a line.

2) Define a function using map, filter, and reduce, to compute one huge
(catenated) string from all the words on all the lines that have exactly one
vowel in them. Assume all the words in a line are separated by a space.

3) Write factorial as a tail-recursive function with an accumulator. Then
translate this tail-recursive function into an equivalent non-recursive
function.

4) Which functions from the previous lecture's problems are tail-recursive or
can be rewritten as tail-recursive accumulators? Translate each into an
iterative function.

5) Rewrite the log function so that it calls eval on its second argument. Use
partial to define notify as defined above; use partial to define show_x such
that show_x('debug') prints [debug]: x = ..the value x is currently bound to..
(hint, us a parameterless lambda); use partial to define time_stamp such that
time_stamp('debug') would print [debug]: ..current date/time.. Hints: see the
now function callable on objects constructed from the datetime class that is
defined in the datetime module (Part 8.1 of the Python Standard Library), and
define a function not a lambda for computing now.

6) In the lecture above we saw that the code
  debug = partial(log, purpose = 'debug')
  debug('some message')
raises an exception. What would the following similar (but not identical) code
print; explain why it does not raise an exception.
  debug = partial(log, purpose='debug')
  debug(purpose='log',message='Here')

7) Write an expression that evalutes to the following representation of a card
deck: an unordered list of strings of the form '2 Hearts', '3 Hearts', ...,
'10 hearts', 'Jack Hearts', 'Queen Hearts, 'King Hearts', 'Ace Hearts' for
Hearts and the other suits: Diamonds Clumbs and Spades. The resulting list
should have 52 values. Hint: see chain and product iterators (which I used
along with map, a lambda, irange and lists): create a product of (a) the numbers
2-10 followed by the named cards (using chain) and (b) the suits; then map each
resulting 2-tuple into the required string form. 

8) Using the following solution to problem 8 from the recursion lecture, modify
it to return the actual stamps needed to make amount, using the minimum number
of stamps. For the new min_stamps function, min_stamps(19) could return either
the stamp list [1,2,16] or [2,5,12]. Hint: use reduce over a list of stamp lists
to returns the shortest stamp list.

def min_stamps(amount):
    denominations = [1,2,5,12,16,24]
    if amount == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return 1+min([min_stamps(amount-d) for d in denominations if amount-d >= 0])
