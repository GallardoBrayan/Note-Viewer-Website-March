<a name="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Now that we have reviewed the fundamentals of classes, we are going to cover
some new material about them: how we can write certain class methods that are
used by Python in a special way: we don't call these methods directly, but
Python calls them automatically based on our us of []s, operators, etc. All
these special methods have their names writen between double underscores (just
like __init__ which is also one of these special methods).

Most of these methods (but not all) are invoked by Python operators (whose
arguments are instances of the class that they are defined in) so we call this
technique "operator overloading": it means overloading (giving more than one
meaning to) the standard operators, applying to objects constructed from
programmer-defined classes (which really is an application of "polymorphism",
which translates to "many forms"). Overloading has a good, not bad, connotation
here. By studying operator overloading, we will better understand how Python
executes our programs, and be able to write classes that are more powerful, by
exploiting our understanding of this mechanism.

Note that this material is also covered in Lutz, "Learning Python", in
Chapter 29. While learning this material, we illustrate each overloaded
operator simply with methods defined in a "simple" class, Vector. Later we will
apply this technique to a bigger examples; but, a typical class has only some
of its operators overloaded: not all operators are meaningfully overloaded for
every class.
</pre>

<a name="init"><h1>__init__</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The example that we will use throughout this lecture is storing and manipulating
Vectors: a mathematical quantity that represents a point in N-dimensional space.
We will represent a Vector by a tuple of coordinates; the length of the tuple
(its number of coordinates) specifies the dimension of the space in which the
vector resides.

We'll start with __init__ because you have probably already written many of
these methods. Recall that when you "call the class" (write the class name
followed by parentheses), you can supply it with some arguments. Python creates
an object (something that has a namespace/__dict__) for the instance of the
class and then calls __init__ with a reference to the object it created and all
the  other arguments in the "call of the class".  So calling Vector(a,b,c) leads
Python to call Vector.__init__(self,*args) where self refers to the empty
object Python just created and the *args combines all its matching positional
arguments into a single tuple.

class Vector:
    def __init__(self,*args):
        self.coords = args

Note that self.coords = ... establishes a new name in the namespace of the
constructed object and initializes it to the tuple args. In light of the last
lecture, I should have named this self/instance variable _coords or __coords,
but for simplicity's sake, I'll leave it as coords (I do access that variable,
but only, for illustration purposes, like directly below).
        
Like the methods that we will discuss below, we don't call __init__ directly,
but Python does, automatically, when we "call the Vector class" to construct a
new object from that class.

Note that we can use __init__ another way in Python: we can call __init__ on any
existing Vector object explicitly, to reinitialize its coords attribute.

v = Vector(0,0)
print(v.coords)

v.coords = (1,1)
print(v.coords)

v.__init__(5,5,5,5,5)
print(v.coords)

prints
  (0, 0)
  (1, 1)
  (5, 5, 5, 5, 5)
</pre>
<div class="top"><h4><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></h4></div>

<a name="len"><h1>__len__</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We can call the len function on any object. It translates into a call of the
parameterless __len__ method on the object. The len functioin is defined, and
automatically imported from the builtins module, as approximately the following
code:

def len(x):
    return x.__len__()

Note that some objects (e.g., those of class/type int) do not define a __len__
method, for example the int class. So, if we call len(1), Python raises an
exception and reports:

  TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()

This is exactly because len(1) calls/returns 1.__len__() which FEOOP translates
into type(1).__len__(1) which is int.__len__(1) but the int class defines no
__len__ function, so Python raises an exception.

In fact, Python requires that the len function always return an integer value,
so a more accurate definition of len is

def len(x):
    answer = x.__len__()
    if type(answer) is not int:
      raise TypeError(str(type(x))[8:-2]+' object cannot be interpreted as an integer')
    return answer

Note that str(type(1)) returns the string "<class 'int'>"; likewise
str(type(Vector(0,0)) returns the string "<class '__main__.Vector'>": slicing
[8,-2] respectively produces 'int' and '__main__.Vector'. In fact, my goody
module includes the type_as_str function, who body performs the conversion and
slicing.

def type_as_str(x):
    return str(type(x))[8:-2]

The following code extends our Vector class to illustrate this method. The len
method returns the dimension of the vector: the number of values in the tuple
used to represent the vector.

class Vector:
    def __init__(self,*args):
        self.coords = args

    def __len__(self):
        print('Calling __len__')
        return len(self.coords)


v = Vector(0,0)
print(len(v))

This script prints 'Calling __len__' and then 2.

What do you think would happen if we changed the last statment in __len__ from
return len(self.coords) to return len(self)? Check your intuition by running
this code and justifying the result it produces.
</pre>
<div class="top"><h4><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></h4></div>

<a name="bool"><h1>__bool__</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Whenever Python needs to interpret some object as a boolean value, it calls the
parameterless method __bool__ on the object. For example, if we write an "if"
or "while" statement whose boolean test is just an object, Python attempts to
call the __bool__function on that object to determine whether its boolean
equivalent represents True or False.

Using the definition of Vector above (defining just __init__ and __len__) and
the test function below

def test(x):
    if x:
        print(True)
    else:
        print(False)

when we execute the script

v = Vector(0,0)
test(v)
v = Vector(2,2)
test(v)
v = Vector()
test(v)

it prints

  Calling __len__
  True
  Calling __len__
  True
  Calling __len__
  False

Why is __len__being called?

The actual rule in Python for evaluating an object as if it were a boolean
value is to first try to call __bool__ on the object (which cannot be done
above, because a __bool__ method is not defined) and return its result; if that
method is not present, Python instead returns whether its len is != 0. If
there is no __len__ function Python just returns True (the mechanism to do this
is actually related to inheritance, a topic we will cover late in the quarter).

This rule explains why we can test list, tuple, set, and dict objects as
booleans: if any is empty (len = 0) it represents False, if any is not empty, it
represents True.  Also, the object None has a boolean value of False (the
NoneType class specifies a __bool__ method that always return False).

So, when v = Vector(0,0) or v = Vector(2,2), len(v) is 2 which is != 0, so it
is treated as True. When v = Vector(), len(v) is 0 which is not != 0 so it is
treated as False.

But we want to interpret vectors as bool values differently. We will define
Vector so that an instance is True if self.coords is not the origin: any of the
coordinates in self.coords is not 0.

class Vector:
    def __init__(self,*args):
        self.coords = args

    def __len__(self):
        print('Calling __len__')
        return len(self.coords)

    def __bool__(self):
        print('Calling __bool__')
        return not all( v==0 for v in self.coords )

Here we use the any function applied to a tuple of bool values, created by a
comprehension, each specifying whether one coordinate in self.coords isn't zero.

So the boolean value for Vector(0,0) would return False, and so would Vector()
(because all(()) is True). But Vector(2,2) would return True: all return their
values because Python uses the __bool__ function supplied above, and doesn't
have to (nor does it) call the len function to compute an answer.

Note, if we wrote

        return any( v!=0 for v in self.coords )

we would get the same result, except for Vector(), because any(()) is False.
So according to our definition, the one value corresponding to a 0-dimensional
vector has the boolean value True.

--------------------

Interlude: Short-Circuit Logical Operators: and their real meanings

The operators and/or are called short-ciruit operators, because unlike other
operators (which evaluate both of their operands before being applied), short-
circuit operators evaluate only their left operand first, and sometimes don't
need to evaluate their right operand: True or ... is True and False and ... is
False. So if the "or" operator's left operand is True, it doesn't need to
evaluate its right operand: the result is always True; and if the "and"
operator's left operand is False, it doesn't need to evaluate its right operand:
the result is always False. This rule saves time, but it is more important for
another reason (discussed below).

If the left operands of and/or is True/False it must evaluate the right operand
in order to compute its result.

So, for example, if we wrote the following if/test (assume d is a dict)

  if k in d.keys() and d[k] == 0:
      ....

Python would first evaluate the expression: k in d.keys(). When False it would
determine the value of the "and" operator is already known, and it is False. It
would not have to evaluate d[k] == 0, which is a good thing, because evaluating
d[k] would throw a KeyError exception, because k is not a key in d: just what
i in d.keys() is checking. 

So, while short-circuit operators can save a little time, that is not their
most important purpose; avoiding raising exceptions is the primary reason that
and/or operators are short-circuit.

Even without short-circuit operators, we could write this same statement as

  if k in d.keys():
      if d[k] == 0:
          ....

But that requires a nested if statement and is much more cumbersome to write. It
is better to spend some time learning about short-circuit operators now, and
then be able to use them appropriately later, to write simpler code.

----------
Going really deep into and/or

Finally, the exact meaning of and/or is a bit more subtle, and concerns the
boolean interpretation of values (i.e., the __bool__ methods). Let's look at and
first. If the boolean interpretation (computed by __bool__) of the left operand
of "and" is as False, we know that we don't have to evaluate the right operand.
We said that the result is False, but realy the result is the actual value of
left operand, not its boolean interpretation. So [] and ... evaluates to [] (a
value whose boolean interpretation is False).

Likewise if the boolean interpretation (computed by __bool__) of the left
operand of "or" is True, we know that we don't have to evaluate the right
operand. We said that the result is True, but realy the result is the actual
value of left operand, not its boolean interpretation. So [1] or ... evaluates
to [1] (a value whose boolean value is True).

Similarly, if the boolean interpretation of the left operand of "or" is False,
we need to evaluate the right operand to compute the result of "or", and the
result will be the value of just the right operand (not its boolean
interpretation): so (any value considered False) or [] is [], and (any value
considered False) or [1] is [1].

Likewise, if the boolean interpretation of the left operand of "and" is True, we
need to evaluate the right operand to compute the result of "and", and the
result will just be the value of the right operand (not its boolean
interpretation): so (any value considered True) and [] is [], and (any value
considered True) and [1] is [1].

Most programmers use logical operators where boolean values are needed (like in
"if" and "while" loops), so regardless of their strange results, we are
interested only in the boolean interpretation of the result (which correponds
to our intution about and/or). But the reality in Python is a bit subtler, and
sometimes programmers do rely on understanding the exact meaning of the and/or
operators.
----------

Note that "not" has only one operand, so there is no way to short-circuit it.
Also, note that "not" always returns a bool value (unlike what we learned
above). That is, not [] evaluates to True; not [1] evalutes to False.

<a name="repr"><h1>__repr__ and __str__ (and other conversion functions)</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Python can call two methods that should return string representations of an
object. The __str__ method is called when the conversion function str is called:
so again, this is like len: Python translates str(x) into type(x).__str__(x).

For example, the print function calls str on all the arguments that it prints.
If there is no __str__ method in this class, Python tries calling the __repr__
method as a backup to produce the string (if we call repr(x) Python returns
x.__repr__() for this method, similarly to what it does for len(x) and str(x)):
if that fails, Python reverts to its standard method for computing a string
value objects: a bracket string with the name of the object's class and the
location of this object in memory (as a hexidecimal number).

So in the Vector class as it was defined above, without defining __repr__ or
__str__, if we write

v = Vector(0,0)
print(v)

Python prints something like

  <__main__.Vector object at 0x027CE470>

The requirement for __repr__ is that it returns a string, which if passed as the
argument to the eval function, would produce an object with the same state. So
if v = Vector(0,0) the repr(v) should return 'Vector(0,0)'. For Vector, we
can define __repr__ as follows

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Vector('+','.join(str(c) for c in self.coords)+')'

Note that join expects an iterable as its argument, and it expects each object
produced to be a string. So, we specify a tuple comprehension that is the str
conversion of every coordinate in self.coords.

Now, if we executed the code above, Python prints the following (there is still
no definition of __str__, so __repr__ is called).

  Vector(0,0)

And sure enough, writing

x = eval(repr(v))
print(type(x),x)

would print

  <class '__main__.Vector'> Vector(0,0)

Here x refers to an object whose state was the same as v's object state.

In fact, similar to the len function, Python requires that the str function
always return a str value, so a more accurate definition of str is

def str(x):
    answer = x.__str__()
    if type(answer) is not str:
      raise TypeError('__str__ returned non-string (type '+type_as_str(answer)+'))
    return answer

__str__ should return a string that nicely formats interesting aspects (maybe
all instance variables, maybe not) of the object. Some objects have more
instance variables than those needed to construct the object. The __str__ below
just returns the Vector as a list of its coordinates, prefeaced by its
dimension. So if v = Vector(0,0) then str(v) returns '(2)[0,0]'

    def __str__(self):
        return '('+str(len(self))+')'+str(list(self.coords))      # using +
       #return '({d}){c}'.format(d=len(self),c=list(self.coords)) # using format

Unlike for __repr__, Python places no requirements for result that __str__ 
returns, we can use our judgement as to how best to show the string
representation of objects. Typically we use __str__ for debugging, when calling
the print function, which automatically calls the str function on all its
positional arugments.
    
Finally the other type coversion functions: int, float, complex, oct, hex, and
trunc call the Python methods __int__  __float__  __complex__  __oct__  __hex__
__trunc__.

So, we could define

    def __int__(self):
        return len(self.coords))

If we did, and assumed v = Vector(0,0), then int(v) would return 2; if we
did not define any __int__ function, then calling int(v) would raise the
following exception: 

  TypeError: int() argument must be a string or a number, not 'Vector'

Of course, the real int conversion function looks more like

def int(x):
    answer = x.__int__()
    if type(answer) is not int:
      raise TypeError('__int__ returned non-string (type '+type_as_str(answer)+'))
    return answer

<div class="top"><h4><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></h4></div>

<a name="relational"><h1>Relational operators</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
__lt__ (__gt__, __le__, __ge__, __eq__, __ne__): < (>, <=, >=, ==, and !=)

In this section, the overloaded operators that we discuss are really operators,
and we overload their meaning to compute values on new classes/types. Python
translates any occurrence of a relational operator into a call on the
appropriate method for its LEFT operand: x < y is translated to x.__lt__(y)
which by the Fundamental Equation of Object Oriented Programming is translated
into type(x).__lt__(x,y) or, assuming Vector is a class and x is of type Vector,
Vector.__lt__(x,y).

Please note that int is just a class in Python, so it translate 12 < x into
type(12).__lt__(12,x) which is equivalent to int.__lt__(12,x). That is really
what is happening in Python when we use the < operator: using < with an integer
first/left argument calls the method __lt__ defined in the class the first/left
object 12 is constructed from (and 12 is an int).

When studying relational operators, we will first look at comparing objects from
the same class, and then we will extend our understanding to how Python compares
objects from different classes (which is a bit more subtle).

--------------------
1) Comparing objects from the same class:

We will start our discussion by defining these relational operators to work
when comparing two objects from the Vector class. Later we will discuss how to
expand them to compare against other types (here, just float).

If we wrote

x = Vector(0,0)
y = Vector(2,2)
print(x < y)

Python raises the exception:

  TypeError: unorderable types: Vector() < Vector()

Likewise, it raises the same exception for

print(x < 10)

Python raises the exception:

   TypeError: unorderable types: Vector() < int

And finally, it raises the same exception for

print(10 < x)

Python raises the exception:

   TypeError: unorderable types: int < Vector()

Unorderable here means that there is no way known to Python go determine whether
a Vector is less than an int, or wheether an int is less than a Vector()

Note that the cause of the problem in the first two cases is that the Vector
class defines no __lt__ method. Python translate x < ... into
type(x).__lt__(x,...) which is equivalent here to Vector.__lt__(x,...). But
there is no __lt__ method defined in the Vector class.

In the third case the int method does define a __lt__ method, but it does not
know how to compare integers to Vectors. Vectors are a type defined by us, so
there is no way the int class, which has been built into the Python system, can
know about them. Python translate 10 < x into type(10).__lt__(10,x) which is
equivalent here to int.__lt__(10,x).

So, there is no built-in meaning for comparing an object of class/type Vector
with any object of any type. There is no Vector.__lt__ method. But, by defining
a __lt__ method in Vector, there is a method for Python to call when
it needs to compute the < operator on two operands, whose left/first operand is
an instance of the Vector class.

So to start, let's add the following two definitions to the Vector class. Also
assume we have imported the math module (by import math). Here, distance
computes the distance from the origin to the coordinate specified by the Vector;
one Vector is less than another if its distance is smaller.

    def distance(self):
        return math.sqrt( sum( v**2 for v in self.coords ) )

    def __lt__(self,right):
        return self.distance() < right.distance()

Notice the < operator in __lt__ is not recursive! Python calls the __lt__
method above when comparing two objects constructed from the Vector class; but
inside this method the < operator is called on two float value returned by the
sqrt function in distance, so it calls the __lt__ method defined in the float
class:

   self.distance() < right.distance()

   type(self.distance()).__lt__(self.distance() , right.distance())

   float.__lt__(self.distance(),right.distance())

to compute the result: calling a __lt__ method defined in a different class.

The __lt__ method above would be recursive if its body were return self < right
(causing inifinite recursion, a topic that we will cover in depth later).

So now, when evaluating x < y in the example below, the method call
Vector.__lt__ is found and it is called with arguments (x,y): as in
Vector.__lt__(x,y).

x = Vector(0,0)
y = Vector(2,2)
print(x < y)

Python prints: True

What if we changed the print to print(x > y) and executed the code? Would Python
throw an exception because there is no __gt__ method defined in class Vector?

It turns out Python is able to compute the correct answer. How Python evaluates
> in this case is a bit more complicated. It first tries to call
Vector.__gt__(x,y) but an exception is raised because __gt__ is not defined in
Vector. Mathematically, x > y is true exactly when y < x is true: so, Python
tries to use the __lt__  method to compute the __gt__ method if we reverse the
operands: Vector.__gt__(x,y) is the same as Vector.__lt__(y,x). So Python tries
to evaluate y < x, which means Vector.__lt__(y,x) which successfully computes
its answer: False.

So, we can let Python implicitly call __lt__ with the operands reversed, as
above, or we can explicitly implement __gt__ either directly (as we did for
__lt__) or we can implement __gt__ by having it explicitly call __lt__ with the
arguments reversed. Either

    def __gt__(self,right):
        return self.distance() > right.distance()

    def __gt__(self,right):
        return right < self # or right.__lt__(self) or Vector.__lt__(right,self)

So there are a variety of implicit and explicit ways in which we can use the
__gt__ method to compute the correct result. Finally, note that we can get the
same behavior by defining only __gt__ which Python will call with reversed
operands if it needs to compute the __lt__ and that method is undefined.

Python can use __lt__ to compute __gt__ and __gt__ to compute __lt__ as needed.
So, writing one of these pairs allows Python to compute both relations.

In the next secton we will see why it is useful to define both explicitly.

What if we changed the print to print(x <= y) and executed the code?

Python again raises the exception:

  TypeError: unorderable types: Vector() <= Vector()

In fact, the __le__ and __ge__ pair of methods are opposites like __lt__ and
__gt__. If we define the __le__ method, and Python needs to compute x >= y, it
will try the call to Vector.__le__(y,x), because x >= y is true exactly when
y <= x is true. And if we define the __ge__ method and Python needs to compute
x <= y it will translate the call to Vector.__ge__(y,x), because x <= y when
y >= x.

Finally, if we don't define an __eq__ method, Python substitutes the "is"
operator; if we don't define a __ne__ method Python call __eq__ and negates
the result. So unlike the other pairs, in this pair, an undefined  __ne__ method
calls __eq__ but an undefined __eq__ will not call __ne__, it uses the "is"
operator. For example, with neither __eq__ nor __ne__ defined

x=Vector(0,0)
y=Vector(0,0)
z=x

print(x == y, x is y, x == z, x is z)
print(x != y, x is not y, x != z, x is not z)

Prints

  False False True True
  True True False False

Here  ==/is and !=/is not  produce the same results because we have not defined
__eq__ or __ne__ methods

----
is vs. == interlude

Recall that the "is"  operator is called the object-identity operator. It
evaluates to True when its left operand refers to the SAME OBJECT as its right
operand. In the pictures that we have been drawing, this means the left/right
references (arrows) refer to the same object.

The == operator (when present) should compare objects by their state. It is
possible that two different objects (objects for which "is" evaluates to False)
store the same state, so for them == should evaluate to True. This is the case
for the objects x and y shown above: they refer to different objects, but each
of the objects referred to has the same state: the self.coord reference of each
refers to a tuple containing (0,0).
----

So, if we define the __eq__ method as follows (True when the tuples are same
regardless of identity)

    def __eq__(self,right):
        return self.coords == right.coords

print(x == y, x is y, x == z, x is z)
print(x != y, x is not y, x != z, x is not z)

now prints

  True False True True
  False True False False

So in summary, to get all six relational operators to work correctly for
comparing two objects of the same class, we can define all six or choose one of
__lt__/__gt__, one of __le__/__ge__, and always __eq__ to define, and Python
will call one of these to compute the correct value for any of the undefined
relational operators.

Note that although Python doesn't do it, we can implement all the relational
operators using only < (or > or <= or >= we show only < below): although this
approach might not be efficient in execution, the last 5 methods would be the
same in every class, all depending on the meaning of __lt__. In fact, here is
the equivalence (each proven by the law of trichotomy: x < y, x == y, or x > y)

Relation |  < only + logical operators
---------+------------------------------
 x <  y  |      x <  y
 x >  y	 |      y <  x
 x <= y	 | not (y < x)
 x >= y	 | not (x < y)
 x == y	 | not (x < y or y < x)
 x != y	 |      x < y or y < x,  or we could write not(x == y), using ==

So, we could write each of these operators as illustrated above and be able to
compare values from the Vector class in all possible ways. We will later see
how to use a mix-in via class inheritence to simplify this process. You can
also look in the functools module in Python's library for the total_ordering
decorator, which supplies the other operators so long as the class defines one
of __lt__, __le__, __gt__, or __ge__ and also supplies the __eq__ method.

--------------------
2) Comparing objects from different classes:

Now we will discuss what we must do if we also want Python to be able to compare
objects of different types: here compare objects from the Vector type with
objects of a numeric type (int or float). In the example below, again, assume x
refers to an object constructed from the Vector class.

Writing the code print(x < 15) won't magically work. As you would suspect,
this will not end well, because Python raises the exception: 

  AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'distance'

(in the body of the __lt__ method). The current definition assumes type(right)
is Vector, but here it is an int. Now, maybe it makes NO sense to do such a
comparison, so raising this exception is as good as doing anything else; or,
maybe we should test whether type(right) in (int,float) and raise a different
exception with a better message. The accepted exception to raise is TypeError,
which with the correct string would produce the same result as if the method
were not defined (see below).

But if it makes sense to compare a Vector and an int/float, we can write more
code to fix the "problem", expressing how to compare Vectors to integers/floats.
Suppose that we decide for __lt__ to compare the distance of the Vector value
with the int/float. For  these semantics, we can rewrite __lt__ as 

    def __lt__(self,right):
        if type(right) is Vector:
            return self.distance() < right.distance()
        elif type(right) in (int,float):
            return self.distance() < right
        else:
            raise TypeError('unorderable types: Vector() < '+type_as_str(right)+'()')

Here, if the type of right object is Vector, we do the standard comparison we
did before, but if the type is either int or float, we perform the necessary
call (on the distance method) before doing the standard numeric comparison with
the right numeric value. If type(right) is neither Vector nor int nor float, we
raise the TypeError exception, meaning trying to do the comparison is not valid.

Now it is time to explore an interesting asymmetry when Python evaluates
relational operators, and how to avoid any possible problems.

-----
(1) If we extend __lt__ to cover a right argument that is an int (as we did
above) and do not define an explicit __gt__ method similarly, then Python will
try, but fail to compute print(x > 15) correctly: remember that Python would
first translate this expression into type(x).__gt__(x,15)  which is equivalent
to Vector.__gt__(x,15); if Vector.__gt__ is not defined, Python tries to compute
x > 15 equivalently by computing 15 < x. But this expression won't work
correctly, because Python will translate 15 < x into type(15).__lt__(15,x)
which is equivalent to int.__lt__(15,x); but the int class does not (and cannot
-see the next paragraph) know how to compare an int object to a Vector object.
Python would raise the exception: TypeError: unorderable types: int() > Vector()

(2) If we define a __gt__ method

    def __gt__(self,right):
        return right < self # or right.__lt__(self) or Vector.__lt__(right,self)

then 15 < x would call int.__lt__(15,x) and fail to produce a result, so Python
would translate it to x > 15 and call Vector.__gt__(x,15), but that would be
computed as 15 < x, which would get us back where we started and cause infinite
recursion. Technically, an exception is raised: RuntimeError: maximum recursion
depth exceeded.

(3) If we define a __gt__ method

    def __gt__(self,right):
        if type(right) is Vector:
            return self.distance() > right.distance()
        elif type(right) in (int,float):
            return self.distance() > right
        else:
            raise TypeError('unorderable types: Vector() < '+type_as_str(right)+'()')

Now Python translates 15 < x into type(15).__lt__(15,x) which is equivalent to
int.__lt__(15,x); but the __lt__ method defined in int raises an exception when
it tries to process the second argument: an object constructed from class Vector
which int doesn't know about. But in this case, Python next tries to evaluate
15 < x by evaluating x > 15, which translates into type(x).__gt__(x,15) which is
equivalent to Vector.__gt__(x,15), which now computes the correct answer
(assuming we have defined __gt__ properly in the Vector, as illustrated above).
-----

The int/float classes were written before we wrote the Vector class, so they
know nothing about comparing ints/floats to objects constructed from the
Vector class. And, we cannot change the int/float class to compare against
objects constructed from the Vector class. The int/float classes are built into
Python. So, it is the Vector class that must know how to compare ints/floats
against objects constructed from the Vector class. Thus, if it makes sense to
compare objects of the Vector class against ints/floats (and objects of any
other already defined classes) we must define all 6 relational operators in
class Vector, each one explicitly performing its comparison.

Recall that chained relational operators are translated into pairwise
comparisons joined by "and": e.g., a < b < c == d is translated into
a < b and b < c and c == d.

Finally note that we can make a < b do whatever we want. We could make it print
values, change the state of a or b, do whatever we can do with Python code. But

Here is where beginners might go wild by adding all sorts of strange meanings
to using the < operator; but more experienced programmers will ensure that all
relational operators are pure accessors and just return a bool value (not even
one that can be interpreted as a bool value using the __bool__ method) without
making any state changes in the arguments.

We can summarize the rule Python uses to determine how to compute x < y:

  (1) Try to call type(x).__lt__(x,y)

  (2) If this produces a result, that is the result of the comparison

  (3) If there is no such __lt__ method, or calling it raises an exception,
        (which is handled by Python internally), then try to compute y > x: call
        type(y).__gt__(y,x); if this produces a result, that is the result of
        the expression
 
  (4) If there is no such __gt__ method Python raises a TypeError; if there
        is a method, but calling it raises an exception, Python propagates the
        exception (Python doesn't handle it internally)

  1< v  	    	   	is translated to
  1.__lt__(v)		which by FEOOP is translated to
  type(1).__lt__(1,v)	which Python translates to
  int.__lt__(1,v)	which raises an exception: 
                        int doesn't know about Vector; so Python tries
  v.__gt__(1)		which by FEOOP is translated to
  type(v).__gt__(v,1) 	which Python translates to
  Vector.__gt__(v,1)	which correctly computes the result for Vector and int

<a name="unary"><h1>Unary arithmetic operators: + - ~ (and functions: abs round floor ceil trunc)</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Continuing with overloading operators, when Python recognizes a unary arithmetic
operator (or a binary arithmetic operator, see the next section) it translates
it into the appropriate method call for the class/type of its argument: for
example, it translates -x into type(x).__neg__(x). Suppose that we wanted the
__neg__ operator for Vector to return a Vector object with all of its coords
negated. Generally, as described above, __neg__ should not mutate its operand
but should leave its operand unchanged and return a new Vector object, whose
state is initialized to the appropriate one. Here is a __neg__ method with these
semantics. Note it returns a newly constructed object (of class Vector) with the
appropriate contents,

    def __neg__(self):
        return Vector( *tuple(-c for c in self.coords) )

Notice the use of tuple to create the appropriate negated tuple, and the use of
* to translate the n-tuple to n different positional arguments needed in the
call to Vector's __init__. Here is an example of it code running

v = Vector(1,-2,3)
print(v)
print(-v)
print(v)

which produces the following results; note v's state before and after printing
-v is the same: there is no mutation. Of course we could write v = -v which
also has no mutation, but the name v would be rebound to the object produced by
calling __neg__, so if we printed v again we would see a different result. 

  (3)[1, -2, 3]
  (3)[-1, 2, -3]
  (3)[1, -2, 3]     note that the object v refers to was not mutated

There are two other unary arithmetic operators that we can overload: + and ~
whose methods go by the names __pos_ and __invert__. For Vectors, pos should
return the same vector. Invert is a bit-wise operator, which we won't overload.
So writing ~v would raise an exception.

    def __pos__(self):
        return self

Note that we could return a copy of self, return Vector(*self.coords) but
because Vector is immutable we can share it safely, without the possibility of
it changing (unless the program does somthing bad like v.coords.append(2).

In addition, while discussing arithmetic here, the following unary functions 
(all defined in the math module) abs, round, floor, ceil, trunc work by calling
one of these special methods on its argument (much like len, described above):
so abs(x) returns as its result x.__abs__(). Therefore, if we defined the
following __abs__ method in the Vector class, it returns an object constructed
from the Vector class (containing the absolute values of all the coordinates)

    def __abs__(self):
        return Vector( *tuple(abs(c) for c in self.coords) )

then running the script

v = Vector(1,-2,3)
print(v)
print(abs(v))
print(v)

would print

  (3)[1, -2, 3]
  (3)[1, 2, 3]
  (3)[1, -2, 3]     note that the object v refers to was not mutated

<a name="binary"><h1>Binary Arithmetic Operators: + - * / // % divmod ** << >> & | ^</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Now lets move from unary to binary arithmetic operators, where there are more
operators and they are it bit harder to write correctly. We will start by
discussing one method in particular __add__ and also discuss the need for
another related method __radd__. What we learn about these methods applies
identically to all the arithmetic operators, so we will not dicuss them in
detail here.

Binary arithmetic operators, like relational operators, are written in between
their two operands. Python translates the call x + y into type(x).__add__(x,y).
As with the relational operators and unary arithmetic operators, neither operand
should be mutated, and the method should return a new object initialized with
the correct state. Here is an example of the + operator overloaded for Vector:
to work correctly, the right operand must also be of type Vector and both must
have the same number of coordinates (len of the coords attribute) and the
resulting Vector object has that length, with coordinates that are the pairwise
sum of the coordinates in the two Vectors. Later we will write code so that +
adds Vectors and the values of the int/float numeric types.

    def __add__(self,right):
        if type(right) is not Vector:
            raise TypeError('unsupported operand type(s) for +'+
                            ': \''+type_as_str(self)+'\' and \''+type_as_str(right)+'\'')        
        assert len(self) == len(right), 'Vector.__add__: operand self('+str(self)+') has different dimension that operand right('+str(right)+')'
        return Vector( *(c1+c2 for c1,c2 in zip(self.coords,right.coords)) )

and an example of it running

v1 = Vector(0,1)
v2 = Vector(2,2)
print(v1+v2)

which produces the result

  (2)[2, 3]

Note that we know that type(self) is Vector: that is why the __add__ method in
the Vector class is called. Note also that print(v1+1) raises and prints the
exception

  TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: '__main__.Vector' and 'int'

and if we define v3 = Vector(2,2,2), then print(v1+v3) results in the exception

  AssertionError: Vector.__add__: operand self((2)[0, 0]) has different dimension that operand right((3)[2, 2, 2])

Now recall that we allowed objects from class Vector to compare to int/float
using relational operators: let's also allow addition between Vectors and these
numeric types. Adding a Vector and a numeric value will add that numeric value
to EACH COORDINATE in the Vector.

    def __add__(self,right):
        if type(right) not in (Vector,int,float):
            raise TypeError('unsupported operand type(s) for +'+
                            ': \''+type_as_str(self)+'\' and \''+type_as_str(right)+'\'')        
        if type(right) in (int,float):
            return Vector( *(c+right for c in self.coords) )
        else:
            assert len(self) == len(right), 'Vector.__add__: operand self('+str(self)+') has different dimension that operand right('+str(right)+')'
            return Vector( *(c1+c2 for c1,c2 in zip(self.coords,right.coords)) )

Note that the assertion about lengths is now moved into the else: it shouldn't
be checked when type(right) is an int or float. An an example of it running is

v = Vector(0,0)
print(v+1)
print(v+1.)

which produces the results

(2)[1, 1]
(2)[1., 1.]

We can write this code equivalently as follows, puting the Vector case first,
then the (int,Float) cases, and finally the error case. Either code is
reasonable.

    def __add__(self,right):
        if type(right) is Vector:
            assert len(self) == len(right), 'Vector.__add__: operand self('+str(self)+') has different dimension that operand right('+str(right)+')'
            return Vector( *(c1+c2 for c1,c2 in zip(self.coords,right.coords)) )
        elif type(right) in (int,float):
            return Vector( *(c+right for c in self.coords) )
        else:
            raise TypeError('unsupported operand type(s) for +'+
                            ': \''+type_as_str(self)+'\' and \''+type_as_str(right)+'\'')        

What if we also wanted to allow the expression 1+v? If we try to execute
this code, unsurprisingly Python responds by raising an exception:

  TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'Vector'

because Python calls int.__add__(1,v) and the int class has no clue about
objects of the Vector class (and we cannot change the int class to process
Vectors correctly).

Recall that we covered this problem when discussing __lt__: because the class
of the left operand was used there too, to call the method (sometimes called
"left-operand dispatch"), we would have to change the definition of __lt__ in 
the int class to know about class Vector, which we cannot do.

This problem was solved for relational operators by Python automatically
reversing the operands and calling the __gt__ method: 1 < v always has the same
value as v > 1, where the __gt__ method for v (defined in class Vector) can
include code that checks whether its right operand it an int and process it
accordingly.

But for binary arithmetic operators, Python cannot always find an equivalent
operator to transpose the operands, so it uses a different mechanism to solve
this problem. For examples 1-v is not the same as v-1.

-----
This is because in mathematics, although operators on some operands (ints and
floats with + and *) are commutative, they aren't always. Matrix multiplication
is the first example of non-commutivity that mathematics students often see. For
matrices m1 and m2, m1*m2 does not produce the same value as m2*m1. Likewise
+ is not commutative on strings: 'ab' + 'cd' is not equal to 'cd' + 'ab'.
Because of non-commmutivity, Python solves this problem for arithmetic operators
by using a different mechanism than the one it uses for relational operators.
-----

For every binary arithmetic operator, Python also allows us to define a "right"
version of it: where the method name is prefixed by an r: so __add__ has an
equivalent __radd__ method ("right add"). Here is how we could define __radd__
in the Vector class to successfully compute expressions of the form
int() + Vector().

    def __radd__(self,left):
        if type(left) not in (int,float):               # see note (1) below
            raise TypeError('unsupported operand type(s) for +'+
                            ': \''+type_as_str(left)+'\' and \''+type_as_str(self)+'\'')        
        return Vector( *(left+c for c in self.coords) ) # see note (2) below

By FEOOP, when Python evaluates 1+v, it first tries int.__add(1,v); it doing so
raises an exception because the int class doesn't know how to operate on
Vector operands. Then, Python translates the + into type(v).__radd__(v,1) using
"right-operand dispatch". This methods determines what to do if the left
operand is an int/float. In the method below, relating to the + operator, the
self parameter is the right operand and the left parameter is the left operand.

An example of __radd__ running is

v = Vector(0,0)
print(1+v)

which produces the result

(2)[1, 1]

Note: Two interesting questions are, (1) why doesn't the __radd__ method need
to also check whether type(left) is a Vector and (2) why doesn't its body check
whether self is a Vector.

(1) If left were a Vector, then __radd__ would never be called, because the
left (Vector) argument would result in Python calling the equivalent of
Vector.__add__(left,self) which knows how to compute a Vector result, so it
would never call __radd__ for Vector.

(2) self must be a Vector because Python is calling __radd__ in the Vector
class, so the right argument must be a Vector. If we originally had something
like 1+1 (where the right operand wasn't a Vector) it would never call __radd__
in the Vector class.


A Note on Commutivity to Simplify __radd__:

For arithmetic types/operators that are commutative (e.g., a+b == b+a, which is
true for Vectors) we can write __radd__ by simply calling __add__ with the
arguments reversed: e.g., 

    def __radd__(self,left):
        self + left  # or self.__add__(left)

So 1+v is translated into int.__add(1,v) which fails, so is translated into
Vector.__radd__(v,1) which returns the result of Vector.__add__(v,1) which is
v+1, which has the same value as 1+v because of commutivity.

Again, there are many mathematical structures where + and * are commutative,
although  operators like - and / are typically not commutative. In fact, some
interpretations of + and/or * are not commmutative (e.g., multiplying matrices).
So, we must be careful to write the normal and right versions of all binary
arithmetic operarators correctly.

We now get a point where we can really test our understanding. Here is the rule
Python uses to determine how to compute x + y:

  (1) Try to call type(x).__add__(x,y)

  (2) If this produces a result, that is the result of the expression

  (3) If there is no such __add__ method, or calling it raises an exception,
        (which is handled by Python internally) then call type(y).__radd__(y,x);
        if this produes a result, that is the result of the expression

  (4) If there is no such __radd__ method Python raises a TypeError; if there
        is a method, but calling it raises an exception, Python propagates the
        exception (Python doesn't handle it internally)

For the main example above, here is how Python sees this process

  1+v  	    	   	is translated to
  1.__add__(v)		which by FEOOP is translated to
  type(1).__add__(1,v)	which Python translates to
  int.__add__(1,v)	which raises an exception: 
                        int doesn't know about Vector; so Python tries
  v.__radd__(1)		which by FEOOP is translated to
  type(v).__radd__(v,1) which Python translates to
  Vector.__radd__(v,1)	which correctly computes the result for Vector and int


We have now explored (in about 150 lines of text and code) the relationship
between the + operator and __add__ and __radd__ methods. Here is the complete
list of  operators and their related methods: + - * / // % divmod ** << >> & | ^
translate to __add__  __sub__  __mul__  __truediv__  __floordiv__  __mod__
 __divmod__ __pow__ __lshift__  __rshift__  __and__  __or__  __xor__; also
there is a right form for each of these method: __radd__, __rsub__, __rmul__, 
etc.

One final comment, for arithmetic - operator, if one has defined - and __neg__ 
correctly, one can often implement the __sub__ method as self + -right, which
uses the __neg__ and __add__ methods to compute subtraction: again, this can be
a bit inefficient, but it is very easy to code. If efficiency is an issue, we
can rewrite __sub__ more directly, to execute more quickly.

<a name="delimiters"><h1>Incrementing Arithmetic Delimiters: += -= *= /= //= %= **= <<= >>= &= |= ^=</h1>
<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Again in this section we will look at one incrementing arithmetic delimiter,
+=. Technically this is not an operator, because we cannot compose bigger
expressions with it: += is more like = (a delimiter) than + (an operator). This
same discussion applies similarly to all the other delimiters. For every
arithmetic operator method, there is another method prefaced by i that we can
write and Python will try to call (e.g. __add__ and __iadd__).

Recall that the meaning of x += y is similar to x = x + (y). We parenthesize y
in case it is an expression that contains any operators whose precedence is
lower than +. When Python executes x += y, it tries to execute
x = type(x).__iadd__(x,y): if that method is available and doesn't raise an
exception, that is the result; if it cannot find that method or it raises an
exception, Python executes the code x = x + (y), which also can fail if __add__
is not defined for the types of x and y.

Here is an example of the __iadd__ method for the Vector class, which works for
incrementing objects of the Vector type/class by a Vector or an int.

    def __iadd__(self,right):
        if type(right) not in (Vector,int,float):
            raise TypeError('unsupported operand type(s) for +='+
                            ': \''+type_as_str(self)+'\' and \''+type_as_str(right)+'\'')        
        if type(right) in (int,float):

1) Using your knowledge of the or operator, and the boolean interpretation of
string values, explain what the following statement

   x = string1 or string2

assigns to x in each of the following cases (of empty and non-empty strings)

  string1  |  string2
  ---------+----------
    ''     |     'a'
    ''     |     ''
    'a'    |     ''
    'a'    |     'b'

Rewrite this statement as an equivalent (a) conditional statement and
(b) conditional expression.


2) Assume that we define x = C(['0']) where the class C is defined by

class C:
    def __init__(self,los):
        self.los = los

    def __lt__(self,right):
        if type(right) is C:
            return self.los < right.los
        elif type(right) is int:
            return self.los < [d for d in str(right)]
        else:
            raise TypeError('unorderable types: C() < '+type_as_str(right)+'()')

    def __gt__(self,right):
        return right < self

Explain in detail (as I did in this lecture) how Python attempts to evaluate
12 < x and whether it succeeds or fails, and if it fails -hint: it fails- how
and why it fails.

Answer the same question, if we replaced the defintion of __gt__ above by

    def __gt__(self,right):
        return C.__lt__(right,self)

3) Assume that we define the class C below

class C:
    def __init__(self,los):
        self.los = los

    def __add__(self,right):
        if type(right) is C:
            return C(self.los + right.los)
        elif type(right) is int:
            return C(self.los + [d for d in str(right)])
        else:
            raise TypeError('unaddable types: C() + '+type_as_str(right)+'()')

In what cases can we guarantee that when __add__ is called, self is guaranteed
to be an object constructed from class C? Explain how we can call this method
with a self object that is not constructed from class C.
